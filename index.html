<p>Moreover, many of the conventions informing historiographies of nonhuman animals internalize rather than question their premises (e.g., economic and social histories treat livestock as commodities rather than as beings vulnerable to objectification). As a historian of Indigenous America, I sought to piece together a picture from fragments and read against the grain to excavate perspectives hidden or silenced in European sources. As a historian of Europe and settler colonies, I sought ways to examine this system as an outsider, to undertake close readings in order to find cracks in a seemingly smooth surface, and to learn from Indigenous perspectives. Thus I attempted to estrange myself from European and settler-colonial modes of interaction. Today, humans' relationships with other animals are extremely paradoxical. In certain respects, the divide between humans and animals is narrower than ever. For many people, dogs and cats and other animals are beloved, akin to human family members. In other respects, the divide is wider than ever: people eat, wear, and otherwise consume more animals than at any other point in history, and more creatures live in torturous conditions of confinement before their short lives end in slaughter. In addition, many wild animals are on the verge of extinction because human lifestyles degrade habitats. No satisfactory solution to this paradox and the ethical and environmental chaos that it creates is possible without understanding the historical conditions that made it possible.</p>

<p><strong>The early modern Atlantic world was the site of a seminal and singular stage of globalization—the crucible that catalyzed the modern paradox of simultaneous closeness and distance between people and other animals.</strong> Hunting Subjects The boar, sent by the offended and vengeful goddess Diana, had ravaged the kingdom of Calydon. The king dispatched his son, Meleager, to slay the beast. The prince assembled a group of brave huntsmen with their horses and dogs and went in pursuit. The powerful beast, depicted with an imposing mane and large tusks in Peter Paul Ruben's The Calydonian Boar Hunt, would not be easily vanquished. The boar killed Meleager's friend and accomplice Ancaeus and several of the hounds, their bodies lifeless beneath the boar's hooves. Ultimately, the prince prevailed and speared the animal. Next to him is his beloved (and fellow hunter) Atalanta, whom he will soon reward with the boar's head. The painting depicts the prince and the boar as near equals and puts the human, equine, and canine huntsmen on the same level, all of them noble vassals and essential to the success of the hunt. This tale circulated, along with many other classical stories about hunters and their travails and triumphs, in the ancient Mediterranean and sixteenth- and seventeenth-century Europe in text and image.</p>

<p>Although mythological, it encapsulated the central ethos that aristocratic hunters believed to be the essence of the hunt. It not only showcased their bravery and greatness but also celebrated nonhuman vassals and prey. It would be difficult to exaggerate the importance of hunting for the nobility in medieval and early modern Europe. Huge amounts of social, economic, and political capital were invested in its pursuit—specifically, in time devoted, resources expended, artworks created, palaces built, laws promulgated, and grounds patrolled. The series of events that composed the hunt required both adherence to a script and improvisation. The hunt operated inside both a hierarchy organized by social convention and a meritocracy based on strength and intelligence. It was at once ritual, performance, and "deep play," as defined by Clifford Geertz, that brings into being "central preoccupations" by "assembling actors and arranging scenery." The hunt rewarded individuals for valorous feats and punished them for poor choices and bad luck. It also engendered moments when collective action subsumed individual subjectivities. All of these elements, and others, produced strong somatic states that anchored social and cultural meaning in the body. In her study of medieval hunting treatises, Susan Crane argues that the noble hunt "affirm[ed] the rightness of a single social and natural order headed by the aristocracy." In other words, it constructed a chivalric ethos that legitimated oligarchy. The hunt also fostered interspecies relationships.</p>

<p>Siting a Garden Installing a garden sometimes entails a large change to an area of land that is contained within some political jurisdiction or shares borders with neighbors who are concerned that their interests are not negatively impacted by such an installation. This can happen even in the case of modest residential gardens as home-owners associations develop and enforce rules that govern how landscaping may be installed and maintained. This certainly happens when a garden is large enough to require permitting of various sorts from municipal or even state governments. What can be done on a site constrains what may be done, of course, and so a garden's installation may differ from the original plan for that garden. When this happens, it is relevant to a consideration of that garden. Home-owners associations that require certain kinds of grass, a certain uniformity of garden style across all homes in a neighborhood, flower beds to be located in some places but not others, and so forth, exert a very palpable influence on a garden. While such a garden is rarely the focus of sustained attention as a garden, to the extent to which it is appreciated aesthetically, the HOA's influence may be paramount in understanding why it is as it is.</p>
</details>
<p><strong>Lifespan Factors "Lifespan features" refer to those aspects of objects that involve change throughout the life of that object.</strong> Let's consider three such features, relevant to gardens. The Evolution of a Garden Gardens change as nature changes them, as gardeners react to these changes, and as gardeners redesign aspects of a garden to deal with natural changes, to better suit a garden's purpose, or because the guiding aesthetic of a garden changes. Tracking these changes is important to substantial gardens. A great garden can become a mediocre garden if changes made by gardeners are not principled and well considered. The same can be the case if the resources on which a garden relies dry up, or as different patrons with different priorities assume ownership. On the other hand, a garden well-tended—in both the sense that it is well maintained and that changes are the product of due deliberation—can evolve into being a greater garden than it was when it first began. Trees and plants mature and fill in the spaces originally planned for them; flower production increases; additional plantings to balance color and fill in blank spaces are added: resources originally directed to maintenance that now requires less attention can be used in "capital" ways to enhance the garden. These changes are important to track, not merely to maintain those aspects of the garden we might wish to retain—the original design or what has come to be known as special about the garden—but to ensure that those who return to visit the garden over a succession of seasons or years find the garden that, in some important measure, they remember as that garden. Tracking changes is important for aesthetic experiential continuity, and that is important, as we mentioned, for evaluative, comparative, and interpretative purposes. Most large botanical gardens and many large pleasure gardens devote staff and software to sophisticated plant records departments to track the location, provenance, and lifespan of tens of thousands of plants. Gardens of this status are often hundreds of years old, and their record keeping will include photos, drawings, and descriptions of the landscape as it has grown over time.</p>

<p>수명 요인 "수명 특성"은 사물의 수명이 다하는 동안 변화하는 사물의 측면을 의미합니다. 정원과 관련된 세 가지 특징을 고려해 보겠습니다. 정원의 진화 정원은 자연이 정원을 변화시키고, 정원사가 이러한 변화에 반응하고, 정원사가 자연의 변화에 대처하기 위해, 정원의 목적에 더 적합하도록, 또는 정원의 기본 미학이 변화함에 따라 정원의 측면을 재설계함에 따라 변화합니다. 이러한 변화를 추적하는 것은 실질적인 정원에 중요합니다. 정원사의 변화가 원칙적이고 신중하게 이루어지지 않으면 훌륭한 정원도 평범한 정원이 될 수 있습니다. 정원이 의존하는 자원이 고갈되거나 우선순위가 다른 여러 후원자가 소유권을 갖게 되는 경우에도 마찬가지입니다. 반면에 잘 가꾸어진 정원, 즉 잘 관리되고 변화가 충분한 숙고의 산물이라는 의미에서 정원은 처음 시작할 때보다 더 큰 정원으로 발전할 수 있습니다. 나무와 식물이 성숙하여 원래 계획했던 공간을 채우고, 꽃 생산량이 증가하고, 색상의 균형을 맞추고 빈 공간을 채우기 위해 추가 식재를 추가하는 등 원래 유지관리에만 사용되던 자원을 '자본'으로 사용하여 정원을 개선하는 데 사용할 수 있습니다. 이러한 변화는 단순히 정원의 원래 디자인이나 정원의 특별한 점 등 유지하고자 하는 측면을 유지하는 것뿐만 아니라 계절이나 해를 거듭하며 정원을 다시 방문하는 사람들이 어떤 중요한 면에서 정원을 그 정원으로 기억할 수 있도록 하기 위해 추적하는 것이 중요합니다. 변화를 추적하는 것은 미적 경험의 연속성을 위해 중요하며, 앞서 언급했듯이 평가, 비교, 해석의 목적으로도 중요합니다. 대부분의 대형 식물원과 많은 대형 유원지에서는 정교한 식물 기록 부서에 직원과 소프트웨어를 투입하여 수만 그루의 식물의 위치, 출처, 수명을 추적합니다. 이러한 상태의 정원은 수백 년이 된 경우가 많으며, 기록에는 사진, 그림, 시간이 지남에 따라 성장한 조경에 대한 설명이 포함됩니다.</p>

<p>Ownership and Patronage As the influence of a garden's original patronage is important, so it is important to be mindful of the influence of changing patronage over time. Following the claim that The Garden is an artform and that some gardens are works of art, we might describe "changing patronage" as a garden's provenance (which is usually thought of in other arts as ownership and/or the financial source of its original creation). Different patrons may have different ideas as to what a garden should be, what level of resources should be devoted to it (not to mention that different patrons likely will have different levels of resources at hand), how it should be maintained, and even what its purpose should be. In some cases, changes of patronage make little difference—the karesansui garden at Ryōan-ji has not undergone any significant design change since its creation in the mid-1400s—but in most cases, given that gardens are resource-intensive, patronage changes will mean changes to a garden's properties that in turn impact its aesthetic character. This is often the case when private gardens become public gardens—examples include Chanticleer and Longwood Gardens outside of Philadelphia, Marie Selby Botanical Gardens in Sarasota, The Huntington in Pasadena, and Great Dixter in East Sussex. In all these cases, ownership transferred from one person or family to multiple, and the horticultural aspects of the gardens continued in ways the original owner of the estate may not have envisioned.</p>

<p>Some gardens suffer from another aspect of the wealth distribution problem—namely the allocation of natural resources. The living components of gardens require sunlight, water, and nutrients, and when environmental conditions are not favorable to the garden—say in periods of drought—then the garden must use supplemental irrigation to keep the plants alive. At a certain point in the drought, the city may restrict water use for gardens to ensure that there is enough water for the populace to drink and to grow food crops. This comes at the expense of the garden, but again it is hard to justify prioritization of aesthetic objects over the health of a community. Peat moss, used frequently in potting mixes, is in effect a finite resource, and environmentally conscious botanic gardens are now attempting to reduce their use by employing alternatives such as coconut coir. A garden must decide whether their mulch must come from specifically harvested trees, or if it can come from as a byproduct of tree removal. There is also the question of energy use in the creation of synthetic fertilizers and for the garden's power tools, for example. In all these cases one can imagine a point at which garden maintenance constitutes a waste of energy, natural resources, and emissions. In those cases where ethical concerns are not hypothetical or speculative but exist as empirical realities, they must be taken into account. In those cases where the concerns are less concrete, it will be down to the honest reflection of the person in control of the flow of resources where those resources should flow.</p>

<p>Arguments that require full attention to the lower levels of Maslow's Hierarchy before any attention is due to higher levels—especially when thought of not in localized ways but rather societally, culturally, or globally—are arguments that do not always land. Beauty is a good, and while hunger is a greater evil than beauty a good, critics may suggest that the situation is not a zero-sum game where the two must be placed in head-to-head competition. Critics may argue that there is room for attending to both concerns, to attending to all levels of Maslow's hierarchy simultaneously and with a balance that seems morally justified. This argument may not be found compelling by Peter Singer–style utilitarians, but then not everyone's moral intuitions and commitments are utilitarian in that way. <strong>Many people value gardens as escapes from the ordinary work-a-day world.</strong> They distract us from our problems; they offer a mental oasis. While an argument could be made to suggest that distraction and escape are morally unwarranted—that we should keep our eye on the real and the existentially important—it is difficult to hold simultaneously that the psychology that describes the need of humans for respite and distraction is in error. Escape through aesthetic means may be important to our mental health, individually and collectively, and gardens are a commonly available means of achieving this escape. The good gardens do for us mentally may be, in appropriate balance, equivalent to the good agriculture does for us in terms of filling our stomachs. The trick to getting the ethics right is to know what "appropriate balance" means. We believe this is an effort that must be pursued through individual or particularist moral reflection. Sometimes the garden will win, but sometimes it may not.</p>

<p>Moral considerations are relevant to garden aesthetics because they are relevant to the full case we offer for the aesthetic value of a garden. We judge the aesthetic worth of a garden—if we are judging in ways that are broader than narrowly formalist—by including aspects of that garden that go beyond mere immediate sensory connection. If a garden has a purpose that strikes us as valuable, and if that garden serves that purpose well, and if that purpose has a moral dimension, this may be relevant to how we judge the garden in terms of its overall aesthetic character. Inclusion of consideration of purpose is relevant if we believe that the functional aspects of aesthetic objects are relevant to their aesthetic characters and their worth, and this belief is most easily had when we see that function bound up with our experience of that object as aesthetic.</p>

<p>Connection Roger Paden writes: [A]rchitecture aesthetically appropriates and humanizes nature, understood in terms of space and time: it orients us to space, time, and geography, thereby providing us with a place in the world. But because early gardens, unlike primitive huts, always contained plants, landscape architecture differs from architecture in that it aesthetically appropriates and humanizes nature, understood in terms of life. Landscape architecture can orient us to the biological world by offering an interpretation (1) of the living world around us; (2) of our own nature; (3) and of our place among other living things. It can help humanize our relationship with living nature, help orient us to that nature, and help us dwell in it. This is its ethical function. Gardening allows us to reconnect intimately with the natural world, to be in touch with the ultimate context of our own biological survival and flourishing, and to reestablish rhythms of life in sync with those of that context.</p>

<p><strong>Gardening is an outwardly focused activity, and one of the most important skills of the gardener is close observation of how the outside world changes day to day—how the plants grow, what sorts of animals visit, how much rainfall there has been this week, what anomalies are present.</strong> Those who garden come to appreciate the interconnectedness and interdependence between ourselves and other life, our common evolutionary ancestors, the equal aptitude to life shared by all living species, and the process of nature of which we all are part. Some of the living things that gardens can assist in our orientation toward are other people, that is, other gardeners, those with whom we either share the maintenance of a particular garden or those who, like us, create and nurture their own gardens and with whom we can then share a kind of kinship of common purpose and common investment. Nathan Nun, in discussing themes of societal and social alienation, writes: community garden projects, grassroots efforts to grow food on public and private plots of land in an urban setting, offer a promising example of an environment in which what Herbert Marcuse calls the 'new sensibility' is fostered and plays itself out through practical-aesthetic activity, activity that positively overcomes various forms of alienation. Gardeners see their activities in the gardens as part of a social agreement that builds cohesion within the group and further strengthens a common aesthetic judgment of the garden. The connections we make with the earth are made with other human beings through gardening. We share in common our love of gardens and gardening, our interests in demonstrating ongoing care of living things and of learning all about them for the sake of their flourishing, for the sake of the knowledge itself, and our purposiveness in gardening. Beyond our connections with those with whom we garden, we can appreciate the connections we have with all humans who ultimately must rely on efforts of farming and foraging that at least are substantively like gardening for our survival—and not just with humans but with all animals.</p>

<p>Continuing Creativity In reviewing Cooper's book, A Philosophy of Gardens, Ronald Moore, making a point about gardening but also contributing to a point about the undilutability of appreciating gardens as wholes, writes: The fundamental idea is that properly involved apprehension of an aesthetic object must be comprehensive in taking stock of the whole of that object. In the case of gardens, Cooper points out, it is not enough to experience wholeness as the totality of objects of delectation. True garden wholeness must be apprehended as an integration of natural materials with the purposeful activity of gardening that undergirds the display of materials. The creative act of bringing a garden into being does not end with the garden designer or the garden artist. 'Creation' of a garden may be thought of in two ways. One way is to think about the very first installation of a garden, the manifestation of the gardenist's design, the date we set as the start of a particular garden. The other way is the more philosophically robust, and there the garden is always in a state of creation. This is entailed by The Garden's constant dynamism—the 'nature side' of the ongoing creativity—but it is also a consequence of that fact that gardeners are always undertaking activities that not only maintain a garden in some state relative to its initial design and keep it coherent with its expressed purpose but also make changes that truly amount to alterations of the original design.</p>

<p>In addition, right from birth, babies are predisposed to distinguish between the animate and the inanimate using such cues as whether something can move under its own steam, as a biological being would, or whether it relies on other agencies to move, as inanimate objects do. Even the basis of language, which will play an important role in the development of problem-solving, as we have begun to see in Chapter 2, is already present at birth. Jacques Mehler and his colleagues have found that babies can tell the difference between speech and other sounds within twelve hours of birth; at four days old they can tell the difference between one language and another. Mehler found that French babies respond differently to French and Russian, even when they hear the same person speaking both languages. More striking still, babies are born with the ability to draw certain kinds of inference. Very young babies, for example, can make quite complicated inferences about the things they see. Elizabeth Spelke has found that babies as young as four months can infer that an object is a block with a solid pole behind it if they see the 'pole' move back and forth behind the block. By the age of seven months, babies make this inference whether or not the pole moves, just as an adult would do. And right from birth, babies can recognize similarities between things and recall past events, although these are quite complex processes. Without such basic skills, the infant could not learn and develop. With them, the baby is equipped with some surprisingly general tools for drawing inferences.</p>
</details>
<p><strong>The way that we use our inherent ability to recognize similarities or to recall past events as a basis for everyday inferences was first explored by Daniel Kahneman and his associates in trying to explain why adult reasoning is sometimes apparently illogical and biased.</strong> For instance, many people think that flying is more dangerous than driving, although the reverse is actually true. Kahneman explains this in terms of the way we naturally draw everyday inferences based on what we can recall. In general, familiar, common, or likely events are easier to bring to mind than rare or unfamiliar ones. People tend to ignore the fact that this principle of memory does not always hold true: rare events can be very vivid and memorable, while common events can be so mundane as to be difficult to recall. Yet it is normally safe to assume that common things are more memorable than rare ones and, to invert this principle, to infer that if an event is easily brought to mind, then it must be more common than other events that are harder to bring to mind. Only where the vividness of events makes rare things more memorable than common ones does the principle lead to the wrong conclusion. Equally, people tend to make inferences on the basis of stereotypes, disregarding other kinds of information. Told only that there are a hundred people in a room, seventy of them lawyers and thirty engineers, people correctly deduce that any one individual coming out of the room is more likely to be a lawyer than an engineer. But the minute they are given any information at all about a specific individual, they disregard the prior odds and base their judgment entirely on how closely that individual fits their stereotype of a lawyer or an engineer. So they infer, for instance, that an individual who sounds like the stereotype of an engineer is an engineer, even though, given the odds, it is more likely that he is a lawyer.</p>

<p>Kahneman argues that this way of drawing inferences is an extrapolation from the normal way we recognize similarities. Eleanor Rosch has shown that the more something resembles our conception of a stereotypical member of some category, the more likely we are to accept that it is a member of that category and to assume that it has all of the attributes and properties of members of that category. As with inferences from recall, it is normally appropriate to infer that things that look alike are alike. But in some instances, inferences of this kind lead to problems. There is every reason to suppose that even very young children draw inferences from similarities and from what they can recall, just as adults do. Kahneman believes that the tendency to draw such inferences is unconscious and even unavoidable in certain circumstances. Certainly, drawing inferences in this way is the natural thing to do: it is natural to assume that two things that look alike are alike, and to base judgments on information we can bring to mind, rather than on anything else. Human babies have all the requisite subskills for drawing inferences in this way. In fact, the same is true for animals such as rats and chickens. And indeed, experimental studies confirm that even very young children can draw inferences through these kinds of processes.</p>

<p>Note that this is a slightly curious sense of the word 'expected'. For example, no dice roll will ever show the outcome 3.5, since we only ever get whole numbers, so there is a sense in which we don't expect to see the expected value at all! We should think of it as a long run average across sufficiently many repeats. Different experiments can give the same expected value. For example, if we toss a fair coin with a number 3 written on one side and a number 4 on the other, then the expected value would again be (3 + 4)/2 or 3.5, the same as the dice example. However, clearly the values of the dice roll would be more spread out than the values on the coin. The score of each dice roll could be up to 2.5 away from its expected value, whereas this coin would always be within 0.5 (on one side or the other). We capture this idea that different experiments result in a different spread of outcomes using a quantity called the variance. Unfortunately, the details of how we calculate it are slightly too complicated for this book, but in essence, the more spread out the values, the higher the variance. The expected value tells us where we should start looking for outcomes of the experiment; the variance tells us how far out we might have to look to find them.</p>
</details>
<p>Expected goals The idea of expected value has found a new use recently in sports analytics, for example through the idea of so-called Expected Goals (xG) in football. This has been facilitated by access to enormous amounts of data and computer power but has a mathematical idea at its heart. <strong>As sports fans, we often want to understand more about the game than simply the final score.</strong> Whether our team wins or loses, it can add to the triumph or soften the blow if we know whether the result was a fair one. For this reason, in addition to the number of goals, many news organisations now report data associated with the match. For example, they may give possession statistics (the proportion of time that each side controlled the ball). It's worth saying that all these metrics can be somewhat problematic and can reveal more about a team's playing style than anything else. For example, a team which seeks to defend deep, absorb attacks and then rapidly counterattack may have a low proportion of the possession, even though this can be a highly effective playing style. Leicester City won the English Premier League title in 2016 despite only having the ball 43% of the time all season.</p>

<p>One traditional way of assessing a football team's performance has been simply to count the number of shots they take. Sometimes this is refined to only count shots on target, but even so this can also be a deceptive measure. That is, an attacking team which is frustrated by a well-marshalled defence may resort to a series of speculative shots from long range which are easy for a goalkeeper to save. Their number of shots would be high, but the chances are that this strategy might not result in many goals. It should be clear that not all shots are worth the same. A long-range kick from a narrow angle should not count the same as one taken by an unmarked attacker right in front of the goal. To quantify this, data-minded football followers developed the idea of Expected Goals. Suppose we have a large database of football matches on film and can look at the outcome of each shot. If we group a whole collection of similar shots together, and track the result of each, we can see what such a shot is likely to be worth. For example, if 100 shots from the corner of the penalty area resulted in 12 goals, we might believe that the probability that each such shot results in a goal is 12/100 = 0.12. We can further refine this by considering the position of the nearest defender at the time, for example, separating out shots taken by tightly marked players from those from attackers who find themselves in a lot of space. This is not an entirely well-defined procedure since it requires human judgement and mathematical modelling, different datasets of previous goals may be used to find the probabilities and so on. For this reason, different organisations may quote slightly different Expected Goals values for the same game. However, the spirit of the calculation is always the same. Watching the shots that a team takes, we can add together all these fractional bits of goals together, to give their overall number of Expected Goals over the course of a game.</p>

<p>While the DNA does indeed provide the original sequences (what computer scientists might call the source code) used in the construction of the many proteins participating in these interactions, the relevant sequences are scattered throughout the genome. Furthermore, the dynamics of interaction between proteins and DNA binding sites (whether, for example, a protein functions as an activator or inhibitor) are often determined by features of protein structure that are themselves subject to cellular regulation. In a similar vein, Walter Gehring and his colleagues made headlines when they announced that targeted activation of the eyeless gene in Drosophila induces the formation of full-fledged eyes in fly wings, legs, antennae, and a variety of other tissues that don't normally produce eyes. Because of this success, Gehring suggested that eyeless might be 'the master control gene for eye morphogenesis.'</p>
</details>
<p>One year later, his proposal seemed to be corroborated by the finding that a homologous gene found in the mouse (that is, a gene with extensive regions matching the sequence of eyeless) would, when inserted into Drosophila, work the same magic as eyeless. One might however ask, exactly what does this finding demonstrate? As Gehring himself writes, 'Of course, these eyes were Drosophila eyes... because the mouse provided only the switch gene and Drosophila contributed the other 2,500 genes required to make an eye.' <strong>The eye has a rather special significance in the history of science.</strong> At least since Darwin's day, it has served as the exemplar of design—as a prototype of those 'organs of extreme perfection and complication' the formation of which has for so long defied scientific explanation. As Darwin himself acknowledged, 'To suppose that the eye, with all its inimitable contrivances... could have formed by natural selection, seems, I freely confess, absurd in the highest possible degree.' Given this background, discovery of 'the master control gene' responsible for eye morphogenesis was news indeed. But there is a sense in which this claim is obviously contradicted by the very experiment that has been taken to corroborate it. If the mouse counterpart to eyeless (Pax-6) were truly a 'master control gene,' ought we not to expect that it would induce the formation of a mouse eye and not a Drosophila eye? Might one not interpret the fact that the mouse gene is used by the fly to form its own kind of eye as corroborating a claim of a rather different sort—namely, that eyeless plays a key role in the formation of an eye, the precise nature of which is determined by the context in which the gene finds itself?</p>

<p>In much the same spirit, an alternative reading of this work is prompted by asking, as we did in Chapter 2, what does eyeless do? A member of the class of genes known as homeotic genes, eyeless is said to encode a key transcription factor (a protein that regulates the expression of a number of other genes by its specific capacity to bind to particular sequences of the DNA). But as with so many other eukaryotic genes, the sequence encoding the relevant protein must be constructed post-transcriptionally by splicing. In this sense, the DNA sequence of eyeless might better be regarded as a potential gene. In his recent book, Enrico Coen suggests an alternative description—not 'master genes' but 'master proteins'. Coen writes, 'You can think of the binding site [on the DNA] as a sort of lock, and the matching protein as the key that fits it.' But as Coen clearly recognizes, 'master genes' and 'master proteins' are both inadequate descriptions of developmental dynamics, and perhaps equally so. They are reminiscent of the age-old conundrum of which came first—the chicken or the egg. What makes that question a conundrum is that the answer is so obviously 'Both.' Indeed, the fact that it is not possible to have one without the other may be taken as the defining feature of an organism. As Coen puts it, 'Organisms, from daisies to humans, are naturally endowed with a remarkable property, an ability to make themselves.' Hence the title of his book: The Art of Genes: How Organisms Make Themselves.</p>

<p>Like the rest of us, scientists are language-speaking actors. The words they use play a crucial (and, more often than not, indispensable) role in motivating them to act, in directing their attention, in framing their questions, and in guiding their experimental efforts. By their words, their very landscapes of possibility are shaped. Thus, to understand how gene talk has affected the course of biological research, we need to examine the particular ways in which terms like gene, gene action, genetic program have participated in shaping the biological landscape of the scientists doing that work. In a sense, this is what I have been doing all along in this book. But I have barely scratched the surface. What is missing—and would be absolutely required for understanding the role of language in biological research—is a far deeper investigation of the material, economic, and social context in which that language functions. Accordingly, I take this Conclusion as an occasion to acknowledge the limitations of my account and also to indicate, if only briefly, the kinds of issues involved in a fuller understanding of the work for which gene talk continues, even now, to be useful.</p>

<p>The first point to be made is obvious to any working biologist (and probably to any working scientist): There may be "no single fact of the matter about what the gene is," but neither is there necessarily a problem in such a state of affairs. Indeed, the sort of definitional difficulties historians and philosophers worry about rarely if ever impede biologists in their day-to-day usage of the term. But how can this be? <strong>Don't scientists require great precision in the language they use?</strong> Well, yes and no—that is, in some ways they do, but in other ways, just as in ordinary communication, too much precision would in fact be paralyzing. Where precision is necessary (and absolutely so) is in particular laboratory practices. Moreover, it is from the specificity of the experimental context in which they are invoked that technical terms acquire the precision they need. Terms like gene may be subject to a variety of different meanings; but locally, misunderstanding is avoided by the availability of distinct markers directly and unambiguously tied to specific experimental practices. Within that practice, the marker has a clear and unambiguous reference. Change the practice, and different markers will need to be employed. And inevitably, these different markers will pick out somewhat different physical entities.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, as long as one stays within the context of a given and clearly understood set of experimental conventions, the term gene can still safely serve as an operational shorthand indicating (or pointing to) the marker of immediate experimental significance. But still, wouldn't it be better—not to mention less prone to confusion down the road—to forsake talk of genes and to use only those words that designate the actual markers? Less ambiguous, perhaps, but definitely not better, and for one simple reason. The meaning of an experimental effect depends on its relation to other effects, and the use of language too closely tied to particular experimental practices would, by its very specificity, render communication across different experimental contexts effectively impossible. Some flexibility in terminology is necessary for the construction of bridges between these different contexts; in turn, such bridges work to guide biologists in their exploration of phenomena that are, by definition, still poorly understood, ill-defined, and open-ended. In other words, the construction of scientific meaning depends on the very possibility of words taking on different meanings in different contexts—that is, it depends on linguistic imprecision. Thus a new set of questions arises: Which differences are to be subsumed under one verbal umbrella? How much imprecision is constructive?</p>

<p>As we shall see in the following chapter on Wagner's Tristan und Isolde, Friedrich Nietzsche most certainly felt that it was the (Apollonian) function of artistic form to keep the (Dionysian) forces of chaos and emotional energy under control. Only then could the audience actually bear the experience of seeing and hearing Wagner's opera about the infinite yearning for death. Even if we think in somewhat less extreme terms, however, we might well feel there to be a certain common-sense truth to the notion that artistic artifice can act as a kind of protective buffer. Freud made the psychoanalytic case for the theory in these terms: the audience identifies with the suffering hero onstage, yet also knows perfectly well that the suffering is feigned and not real, that the person on-stage is an actor in a play. This double distancing—through fiction and impersonation—allows the audience to identify, but to do so without danger, and indeed even to experience pleasure at the representation of suffering and death. This would mean that when attending Poulenc's opera, we can become deeply involved in following the story and feeling sympathy for the characters; we can let the music's power work its magic on our emotions. But we will nevertheless not be able to forget that the characters are singing not speaking, that they are enacting not living a story about the fear of death.</p>
</details>
<p>To be frank, we would like to avoid those familiar but perhaps too easy explanations (such as voyeurism, sadism, and masochism) to account for the audience's pleasure in watching the suffering and death of others on stage. Instead, we prefer to test the hypothesis that the act of witnessing staged operatic narratives of death may well function in a different way. <strong>Audiences—of any period—are varied and diverse, but the one thing they share is that they are composed of mortal beings.</strong> But why should they enjoy (or even attend) a staged representation of mortality? Among the many possibilities is the fact that a performance might act as a commemoration or even as a form of therapeutic reassurance in the face of bereavement, making us ponder our social roles in and our emotional responses to the death of others. But is it possible to watch the death of someone on stage without at least for a moment considering one's own demise? We suspect not, even if each person will inevitably react differently. Elisabeth Bronfen has argued that representations of death force us to confront our own end in a kind of "death by proxy": we know we are mortal and must submit to our mortality, yet because (as safely distanced audience members) we do not actually die, but only witness staged death, we can feel as if we are asserting some mastery over the End: "Ultimately, the seminal ambivalence subtending all representations of death resides in the fact that, while they are morally educating and emotionally elevating, they also touch on the knowledge of our mortality, which for most is so disconcerting that we would prefer to disavow it. They fascinate with dangerous knowledge." Would this ambivalence be at all different if the opera were openly and centrally about coming to terms with death?</p>

<p>As suggested in the introduction, we hypothesize that watching and contemplating a performed death in an opera could be seen as analogous to undertaking what the Early Modern period thought of as a pious devotional practice known as the contemplatio mortis, the contemplation of death. Essentially a formal meditation on mortality, this was a late addition to the medieval "art of dying" or the ars moriendi tradition that developed in the context of a generalized social anxiety caused by plagues, wars, and famines. Interestingly and not irrelevantly, the flourishing of the ars moriendi in the late sixteenth and early seventeenth centuries coincides historically with the birth of opera as a distinct new art form in Italy.</p>

<p>Quite possibly the ultimately fruitful notion of synonymy will be one of degree: not the dyadic relation of a as synonymous with b, but the tetradic relation of a as more synonymous with b than c with d. But to classify the notion as a matter of degree is not to explain it; we shall still want a criterion or at least a definition for our tetradic relation. The big difficulty to be surmounted in devising a definition, whether of a dyadic relation of absolute synonymy or a tetradic relation of comparative synonymy, is the difficulty of making up our minds as to just what we are trying to do when we translate a Kalaba statement which is not a mere report on fairly directly observable features of the surrounding situation. The other branch of the problem of meaning, namely the problem of defining significant sequence, led us into a contrary-to-fact conditional: a significant sequence is one that could be uttered without such and such adverse reactions. I urged that the operational content of this 'could' is incomplete, leaving scope for free supplementary determinations of a grammatical theory in the light of simplicity considerations. But we are well schooled in acquiescing in contrary-to-fact conditionals.</p>

<p>In the case of synonymy the tyranny of the developing system, the paucity of explicit objective controls, is more conspicuous. <strong>Identity is a popular source of philosophical perplexity.</strong> Undergoing change as I do, how can I be said to continue to be myself? Considering that a complete replacement of my material substance takes place every few years, how can I be said to continue to be I for more than such a period at best? It would be agreeable to be driven, by these or other considerations, to belief in a changeless and therefore immortal soul as the vehicle of my persisting self-identity. But we should be less eager to embrace a parallel solution of Heracleitus's parallel problem regarding a river: 'You cannot bathe in the same river twice, for new waters are ever flowing in upon you.' The solution of Heracleitus's problem, though familiar, will afford a convenient approach to some less familiar matters. The truth is that you can bathe in the same river twice, but not in the same river stage. You can bathe in two river stages which are stages of the same river, and this is what constitutes bathing in the same river twice. A river is a process through time, and the river stages are its momentary parts.</p>

<p>동의어의 경우 개발 시스템의 폭정, 즉 명시적인 객관적 통제의 부족이 더 두드러집니다. 정체성은 철학적 당혹감의 인기 있는 원천입니다. 나처럼 변화를 겪고 있는데 어떻게 계속 나 자신이라고 말할 수 있을까요? 나의 물질적 실체가 몇 년마다 완전히 교체된다는 점을 고려할 때, 기껏해야 그 이상의 기간 동안 어떻게 계속 나라고 말할 수 있을까요? 이러한 고려 사항이나 다른 고려 사항에 따라 내 지속적인 자아 정체성의 수단으로 변하지 않는 불멸의 영혼을 믿는 것이 좋습니다. 그러나 우리는 헤라클레이토스가 강에 대해 말한 '같은 강에서 두 번 목욕할 수 없다, 왜냐하면 새로운 물이 항상 흘러들기 때문이다'라는 평행 문제의 해법을 받아들이는 데 덜 열심이어야 합니다. 헤라클레이토스의 문제의 해답은 익숙하지만, 익숙하지 않은 문제에 대한 편리한 접근 방식을 제공합니다. 진실은 같은 강에서 두 번 목욕할 수는 있지만 같은 강 단계에서는 목욕할 수 없다는 것입니다. 같은 강의 단계인 두 개의 강 단계에서 목욕할 수 있으며, 이것이 바로 같은 강에서 두 번 목욕하는 것에 해당합니다. 강은 시간의 흐름이며 강 단계는 그 순간적인 부분입니다.</p>

<p>But if we were to point to a, and then wait the required two days and point to b, and affirm identity of the objects pointed to, we should thereby show that our pointing was intended not as a pointing to two kindred river stages but as a pointing to a single river which included them both. The imputation of identity is essential, here, to fixing the reference of the ostension. These reflections are reminiscent of Hume's account of our idea of external objects. Hume's theory was that the idea of external objects arises from an error of identification. Various similar impressions separated in time are mistakenly treated as identical; and then, as a means of resolving this contradiction of identifying momentary events which are separated in time, we invent a new nonmomentary object to serve as subject matter of our statement of identity. Hume's charge of erroneous identification here is interesting as a psychological conjecture on origins, but there is no need for us to share that conjecture.</p>

<p>All of this means that the emotions of others, even of long-dead denizens of historical cultures whose concepts and categories differ substantially from our own, are available as objects of study precisely because the knowledge we need to make sense of anyone's emotion is both conceptual and contextual. We make sense of the world in part through our emotions, but those emotions themselves are permeated by shared linguistic and cultural categories that also depend, in some respects, upon features of the world. In the same way, we make sense of our own embodied states partly through shared linguistic and cultural categories that similarly draw both on features of the world and on features of embodied experience. The fact that both concept and context are fundamental to the ontology of emotions—as experienced, practiced, recognized, and understood—positively requires that emotion research should encompass historical and cross-cultural investigations and comparisons. This comparative perspective is central when it comes to studying emotion in cultures which use or used languages other than our own. Just as we can never entirely share the perspective of another human being, so too we do not—unless we have native competence in both linguistic and cultural terms—wholly share the perspective of those whose languages make different distinctions from our own. Yet translation is always possible, and translation succeeds when it is contextually appropriate. To translate emotion terms and understand emotion concepts in a contextually appropriate manner we need a developed understanding of the various scripts with which the emotion terms of both source and target languages are associated, scripts that are themselves aspects of the relevant emotion concepts. Often enough, we find that particular scripts are associated differently with different terms in different languages. That concepts in different languages are not semantically coextensive is a familiar finding. Yet a given category in the target language may, just as regularly, encompass scripts that are aspects of familiar categories in the source language. Even where the emotion concepts of different cultures are not wholly congruent in the scripts that they cover, nevertheless the scripts, as aspects of those concepts, may be directly comparable. The common ground that comparative conceptual analysis seeks to establish does not warrant either the false exoticism that sees partial congruence as radical difference or the unwarranted assumption that we are all Jock Tamson's bairns.</p>

<p>Emotions are not just subjective, internal feelings or states of mind. They are also implicated in the relations between people, in the external conditions in which they arise and which give rise to them, and in the actions that we take in a given emotional scenario. They have many dimensions, all of which are aspects of the concepts that human beings use when they enact them and when they interpret them. Their specificity can depend on features of the context beyond the skull and the skin—on aspects of pragmatics, performance, and situation, not just on labels. There is no sharp antithesis between inner and outer, emotion and expression, emotion and representation. <strong>Emotions are implicated in context, in social interaction, in narrative, in language, in shared forms of thought, and in culture.</strong> This means that we, as historians of ideas and culture, are in a fortunate position. Many of the skills and insights we use on an everyday basis—the understanding that translation is about ideas, not words; the knowledge that the ideas one translates must be understood functionally and in contextually situated terms; the sense that terms and concepts change over time; the sensitivity to narrative cues about the motives of characters in the diegetic, mimetic, and mixed genres of the literatures we study—turn out to be essential if we are to use our textual sources as material for the cross-cultural and historical study of emotions. Because emotions are by no means only features of some private inner world, we have plenty of scope for investigating them by means of texts that afford us no direct access to such worlds. If, as mechanisms by which we make sense of ourselves, the world, and our place in the world, emotions depend on concepts and on culture, then we should not assume that the emotion concepts of a given culture will necessarily distinguish features that are widely or universally recognized in other cultures. No one will be surprised that cultures vary in their concepts of emotion and of particular emotions. What contemporary constructionist psychology shares with traditional humanities disciplines such as anthropology and philosophy is the conviction that conceptual variation also constitutes variation in the ways in which we experience the world and ourselves as experiencers of it. At the same time, however, contexts and aspects of experience are often similar enough across cultures that emotion concepts exhibit substantial degrees of cross-cultural comparability, at least at a certain level of generality. The linguist Anna Wierzbicka lists a number of ways in which the categories of other cultures capture phenomena that are salient in the English-language concept of emotion: all languages (she claims) possess words which describe a combination of thinking and feeling and which link certain evaluations with typical bodily reactions, and though individual emotion terms are culture-specific, the emotion terms of many languages exhibit a substantial degree of semantic overlap. Not many of us will have the linguistic expertise to test these claims in full, and there are aspects of Wierzbicka's arguments that one might wish to challenge. By contrast, the claim is sometimes made that there are some languages which have no concept at all that is closely comparable to our 'emotion.' Again, this is a claim whose verification would require a huge amount of empirical research and a level of competence in world languages and cultures to which few, if any, of us can aspire. If we are by necessity at the mercy of others' reports, we need to be cautious in assessing their analyses of the evidence they provide. Projects such as this volume can help enlarge our perspective by analysing in tandem the emotion concepts and theories of emotion of two classically foundational cultures.</p>

<p>감정은 단순히 주관적이고 내적인 감정이나 마음 상태가 아닙니다. 감정은 사람들 간의 관계, 감정이 발생하고 유발하는 외부 조건, 그리고 주어진 감정적 상황에서 우리가 취하는 행동과도 관련이 있습니다. 감정에는 다양한 차원이 있으며, 이 모든 차원은 인간이 개념을 제정하고 해석할 때 사용하는 개념의 측면입니다. 그 구체성은 두개골 너머의 맥락의 특징과 레이블뿐만 아니라 실용성, 성과 및 상황의 피부에 와 닿는 측면에 따라 달라질 수 있습니다. 내면과 외면, 감정과 표현, 감정과 표현 사이에는 뚜렷한 대립이 존재하지 않습니다. 감정은 맥락, 사회적 상호 작용, 내러티브, 언어, 공유된 사고 형태, 문화와 관련이 있습니다. 이는 사상과 문화의 역사가로서 우리는 운이 좋은 위치에 있다는 것을 의미합니다. 번역은 단어가 아니라 아이디어에 관한 것이라는 이해, 번역하는 아이디어를 기능적, 맥락적으로 이해해야 한다는 지식, 용어와 개념이 시간에 따라 변화한다는 감각, 우리가 연구하는 다이제틱, 모방, 혼합 장르의 문학에서 등장인물의 동기에 대한 내러티브 단서에 대한 민감성 등 우리가 일상적으로 사용하는 많은 기술과 통찰력은 텍스트 자료를 감정의 문화 및 역사 연구의 자료로 사용하려면 필수적인 것으로 드러났습니다. 감정은 결코 사적인 내면 세계의 특징만이 아니기 때문에, 우리는 그러한 세계에 직접 접근할 수 없는 텍스트를 통해 감정을 조사할 수 있는 충분한 여지가 있습니다. 우리 자신과 세계, 그리고 세계에서의 우리의 위치를 이해하는 메커니즘으로서 감정이 개념과 문화에 의존한다면, 특정 문화의 감정 개념이 다른 문화에서 널리 또는 보편적으로 인정되는 특징을 반드시 구별할 것이라고 가정해서는 안 됩니다. 문화마다 감정과 특정 감정에 대한 개념이 다르다는 사실에 놀라지 않을 사람은 아무도 없을 것입니다. 현대 구성주의 심리학이 인류학이나 철학과 같은 전통적인 인문학 분야와 공유하는 것은 개념적 다양성이 우리가 세계를 경험하는 방식과 그 경험자로서 우리 자신을 경험하는 방식에서도 다양성을 구성한다는 확신입니다. 그러나 동시에 경험의 맥락과 측면은 문화에 따라 충분히 유사하기 때문에 감정 개념은 적어도 어느 정도의 일반성 수준에서는 문화 간 비교 가능성이 상당 부분 존재합니다. 언어학자 안나 위어즈비카는 다른 문화의 범주들이 영어의 감정 개념에서 두드러지는 현상을 포착하는 여러 가지 방법을 나열합니다. 모든 언어에는 사고와 느낌의 조합을 묘사하고 특정 평가를 전형적인 신체 반응과 연결하는 단어가 있으며, 개별 감정 용어는 문화마다 다르지만 많은 언어의 감정 용어는 상당한 정도의 의미적 중첩을 보인다는 것이 그녀의 주장입니다. 이러한 주장을 완전히 검증할 수 있는 언어적 전문성을 갖춘 사람은 많지 않을 것이며, 위어즈비카의 주장에는 이의를 제기할 수 있는 측면이 있습니다. 이와는 대조적으로, 우리의 '감정'과 거의 비슷한 개념이 전혀 없는 언어가 있다는 주장도 가끔 제기됩니다. 다시 말하지만, 이 주장은 방대한 양의 실증적 연구와 세계 언어와 문화에 대한 높은 수준의 역량이 요구되는 주장으로, 우리 중 극소수만이 이를 검증할 수 있습니다. 어쩔 수 없이 다른 사람들의 보고서에 의존해야 한다면, 그들이 제공하는 증거에 대한 분석을 평가할 때 신중을 기해야 합니다. 이 책과 같은 프로젝트는 고전적으로 기초가 되는 두 문화의 감정 개념과 감정 이론을 함께 분석함으로써 우리의 관점을 넓히는 데 도움이 될 수 있습니다.</p>

<p>Though the modern English concept of 'emotion' has a specific and comparatively short history, as Thomas Dixon has emphasized, as a category it also has members that previously belonged to the categories of 'passion' or 'sentiment,' even though these three categories are not coextensive. Other cultures too have and have had categories that share some or many of the features of these English-language categories: the extensive list of pathē given by Aristotle in Book 2 of his Rhetoric consists very largely of items which, even if they would not all necessarily occur to us as prototypical 'best examples' of emotion, would still fall straightforwardly under that category, and which, even if they do not coincide precisely with their nearest English equivalents in sense, reference, extension, and connotation, all have near-equivalents or analogues in English which would be regarded by the average English-speaker as emotion words. This remains true regardless of the facts that (a) pathos in Greek covers a much wider semantic range than English 'emotion' (as Peter Singer explores further in this volume), and (b) even the more specific pathē (or pathēmata) of the psuchē cover more than the forms of experience that we call 'emotions.' The prototypical cases of these pathē of the psuchē, however (as offered, for example, in Aristotle's De anima 1.1 and especially in Rhetoric 2), are largely what we should describe as emotions. The same holds true for analogous concepts in Latin such as animi motus, adfectio, adfectus, passio, and perturbatio. These terms also resemble the English 'emotion' in another way: they highlight the element of phenomenological passivity—the sense that emotions are experiences that happen to us rather than actions that we perform—that is a typical feature of emotion concepts.</p>
