            <p>The old rhetoric of opposition and cooptation assumed a world where consumers had little direct power to shape media content and where there were enormous barriers to entry into the marketplace, whereas the new digital environment expands their power to archive, annotate, appropriate, and recirculate media products. Computer games as co-creative media. We have argued in previous chapters that computer games are largely the product of 'dominant technicities' working within the ambit of very sophisticated, tightly organized industries that are 'risk averse'. In this chapter we want to draw attention to the wide range of production practices that arise from inside player communities themselves. We will argue that these practices constitute interventions that could create a more diverse and culturally enriched medium. In this respect computer games can be seen as prototypical of new media economies insofar as they are an excellent example of the shift from a participatory media culture to what game theorist Sue Morris, talking about FPS games, has termed a 'co-creative' media form. While the concept of 'participatory culture' is familiar from research into television fan communities, I would argue that multiplayer FPS games are 'co-creative media'; neither developers nor player creators can be solely responsible for production of the final assemblage regarded as 'the game', it requires input from both.</p>
        </details>
        <p>This aspect of computer game cultures offers a very significant limit case which affords us empirical evidence into the shifting relationships between media producers and consumers at the beginning of the twenty-first century. <strong>Cultural and Media Studies' conceptualization of audiences has travelled a 30-year path from spectatorship, through active audience theory, to the model of participatory audiences established through studies of fan cultures.</strong> The dissemination of digital media communication has offered media audiences a wide variety of participatory social spaces and sites for producerly activities. These activities were first identified by the tradition of Computer Media Communications study. Lister et al. extend this work into theorizing the shift to productive possibility occasioned by the web. Every message to a bulletin board or conversation in a chat room, every homepage or downloaded MP3 home music compilation facilitates the individual communicating in a pseudo – public sphere mode of address. What is clear is that a great deal of web use facilitates a feeling of participation in media space. In this reading, the increasingly interactive audience is constructed as being part of an ever more intimate feedback loop with media producers. Just as the interactive author has to give away complete textual control to the interactor, so media industries at large recognize that consumers' participation in the 'intermedial' landscape must inform their own production processes.</p>
        <details>
            <summary>다음 문단 보기</summary>
            <p>The understanding of media audiences as having a 'configurative' relationship with media texts of all kinds, developed by Moulthrop and others, is a claim that is fast becoming a central quality of the discourse of new media. The Jenkins quotation at the start of this chapter represents an influential and typical position that argues for new media 'opening up' as we are enabled to 'archive, annotate, appropriate, and recirculate media products'. One way to understand this new agency of the media consumer is through recourse to play theory as a model for audience/text relationships. That is to say, to return to the use of Winnicott made by Silverstone and Hills, in which fan engagements with media worlds, far from representing an unhealthy retreat from social subjectivity 'can be theorised as a form of good health'. This is a compellingly seductive position in many respects – however, we would want to hold onto the context of political economy in order to understand it fully. Corporate media's new 'embrace' of playful fan cultures can also be seen as an extension of the business practice of '360 degree marketing' and 'just-in-time' management techniques, in which enterprises strive to be constantly in touch with consumer behaviour in order to inform production and marketing decisions.</p>

            <p>Ethnicity may be organized horizontally or vertically; the ethnic groups may be ranked or unranked. When they are relatively unranked, inter-group competition for scarce resources is likely to occur, although the degree of ethnicization of such competition depends on the degree of ethnic incorporation. When the groups are ranked, an ethnic stigma is often attached to subordinate groups, typically by way of a set of stereotypes deeming their culture and practices as inferior. Ethnic stigmata can be fought (as in the Black Consciousness movement), but they can also be internalized and become part of the self-identity of the subordinate group. In the latter case, members of the group are likely to try to escape from the stigmatization through changing their way of life. In parts of Latin America, for example, individuals classified as indios (Indians) may change their language (to Spanish) and their mode of dress in order to be re-classified as cholos (mixed people). Ethnic groups do not exist eternally. Whenever they continue to exist as distinguishable social groupings over a long period of time, it is either because of inescapable stigma from greater society or because they offer something deemed valuable to their members. This could be a sense of belonging and ontological security; it could be something more instrumental, such as material gain and economic opportunity.</p>
        </details>
        <p><strong>Economic activity and ethnic identity Long before the term 'ethnicity' became common in anthropological (and other academic) writings, anthropologists had been interested in the relationship between cultural differences and economic activities.</strong> In many of the societies that anthropologists studied, several distinct groups co-existed and forged inter-group trade relationships or structured forms of economic complementarity whereby certain groups specialized in, or monopolized, particular technologies, crops or ecological sub-systems. Thus, in the North-Western province of Pakistan (Swat valley), Frederick Barth (1956) showed how the three ethnic groups living in a particular area occupied different 'ecological niches'. The ecological perspective was commonly applied to studies of ethnic complementarity or 'symbiosis' at the time, and Barth argued that the mutual dependence could be likened to the relationship between species in an ecosystem. The dominant group, the relatively centralized Pathans, were cereal farmers whose geographical boundary coincided with the point of altitude beyond which two annual harvests became impossible. Beyond this boundary, the Kohistanis had adapted to a dual economy of less-intensive agriculture and livestock. The third group, the Gujars, were 'symbiotically' related to both Kohistanis and Pathans in their respective areas. They were livestock herders who exchanged goods and services with the dominant populations to varying degrees. A combination of ecological and political factors served to create particular configurations in different parts of the valley.</p>
        <details>
            <summary>다음 문단 보기</summary>
            <p>In more recent research on ethnicity, with which this chapter is mainly concerned, the ecological dimension is rarely made explicit in such a way. Instead, the main concern has consisted – following, inter alia, Barth's later work on ethnicity (1969a, 1969b) – in exploring the maintenance of ethnic boundaries and the flow of resources associated with them. Characteristically, in a later analysis of ethnicity in Swat, Barth (1969a) showed how ethnic boundaries could be transgressed: political competition between Baluchs and Pathans made it advantageous for Pathans to redefine themselves as Baluchs. In other words, there was no direct link here between economic activity and ethnic membership. By way of contrast, Haaland (1969), in a contribution to the same book in which Barth's paper appeared, showed that a change in livelihood could entail a change in ethnic identity. His material from western Sudan showed that Fur people who, due to varying circumstances, switched from agriculture to livestock herding, effectively became Baggara. The question, then, is not whether there is any relationship at all between ethnic identity and economic activity: it is quite clear that such a relationship can usually be identified. Rather, we must ask what kind of relationship can be envisaged. A few brief illustrations may indicate the range of variation in this regard. In sub-Arctic northern Scandinavia, the relationship between Sami reindeer herders and sedentary Scandinavian farmers and fishermen has been characterized by economic complementarity and, in recent decades, competition over territorial rights. At the same time, a great number of Sami are, and have been for generations, permanently settled on the coast, where their economic activities are hardly distinguishable from those of the Norwegian majority. In spite of minimal observable cultural and economic differences, the ethnic boundary remains stable in some communities, while in others there has been a gradual shift to Norwegian ethnic identity. Recent ethnic revivalism in coastal northern Norway takes place independently of economic processes and is largely a product of changed self-definitions and acquisition of key cultural skills such as Sami language. In other words, a change in economic activities can, but need not, be accompanied by a change in ethnic identity.</p>

            <p>I maintain that a fertile approach to research in science education is grounded in the adoption of a fresh theoretical framework for learning and doing science. I use theory in the spirit of Karl Popper (1974) that our theories are our inventions; but they may be ill-reasoned guesses, bold conjectures, hypotheses. Out of these we create a world: not the real world, but our own nets in which we try to catch the real world. I argue that tinkering with the dominant ideology does not offer the fertile insights needed in science education. In making a case for change I am not arguing for a new way to replace the old. My stance is in opposition to the idea that there is a correct way to see the world, to interpret the work of others, and to apply theory to science education. I am arguing for polysemy. Accepting Difference Adherence to monosemy, an ontological stance, may be at the root of a dire problem in science education. As I mentioned in the previous section, my polysemic stance supports a multilogical foundation for science education. In contrast, monosemy can motivate moves toward assimilation; a one-size-fits-all approach to science education with winners and losers, oppressors and oppressed. This has been the status quo during my career as a science educator.</p>
        </details>
        <p><strong>Throughout the history of science education there have been paradigm wars, debates in the literature in which the expectation was that one way of seeing the world would prevail.</strong> In a sense the view of our field was shaped by Comtean positivism that there was a correct theory for learning and teaching science and the role of scholars was to find that theory through careful conceptual analysis supported by formal empirical analysis. Obviously polysemy is an alternative to this quest for the Holy Grail. There are numerous stances that can be taken to others' scholarship. Our first inclination was to ignore most conceptual change research. Even the best of the research had little relevance to our projects and to an increasing extent the foci and methods were such that there was little overlap with our chief concerns. Perhaps our approach might be thought of as telling the group to go play in some other sand patch. There was no room for conceptual change research or researchers in our projects. There were exceptions. For example, in a large collaborative study in Australia we intentionally included diverse perspectives in the design. Leading researchers in that study included David Treagust, Barry Fraser, and John Wallace. However, the book project we planned to disseminate what we learned from the study was never a priority and was not published. Instead, papers and chapters were eventually published separately.</p>

            <p>My theoretical journey from 1980 to the present day might be described in terms of six epochs, though with a finer grain size it seems as if each year (at least) might be listed as a significant point on a continuously evolving trajectory. As Thomas Kuhn pointed out in relation to scientific discoveries, such as the discovery of oxygen, it is not easy to pinpoint a date at which a particular way of thinking was predominant, even in autobiography. Given this caveat, the six points on my theory trajectory are: neo-Piagetian, radical constructivism, metaphors, social constructivism, theories of action, and cultural sociology. As is the case in any trajectory any one point can be examined with a finer grain size to reveal an extensive bricolage consisting of theories that are to some extent complementary. In an endeavor to show how this works, I take cultural sociology as a point of departure for the remainder of this chapter. Social and Cultural Theory The search for new theoretical spotlights is relentless. In 1997 I took a bold step in pronouncing that learning involved cultural production. The stance included diverse perspectives in collaborative research highlights the difficulties of navigating difference within the field of science education. There seems to be greater payoff for the hard work of being a scholar, to collaborate with those with whom our approach is commensurable, where the theories comprising our bricolage are complementary.</p>

            <p>In the study of postsocialist societies, various scholars have explored the dynamics of economic and social transformations. Humphrey (1998) discusses the persistence of Marxist ideologies in Russia despite the official end of socialism. In another work, Humphrey (2000) examines the social relations of barter in provincial Russia, highlighting the complexities of non-monetary transactions. Similarly, Konstantinov explores trader-tourism in the Balkans as a metaphor for post-totalitarianism, while Lampland (2002) discusses the advantages of collectivization in the postsocialist economy. These studies collectively provide insights into the adaptations and resistances within postsocialist societies, emphasizing the interplay between old ideologies and new economic practices.</p>
        </details>
        <p><strong>The concept of barter and its role in economic exchanges has been a subject of interest for many anthropologists.</strong> Barter is often seen as a distinct category of exchange, separate from commodity exchange and gift exchange. It involves the direct exchange of goods and services without the use of money, and is characterized by the coincidence of wants. Barter can occur in various forms, such as inter-business exchanges or as a means for peasants to obtain necessary goods. The social relations involved in barter are complex, as they often involve negotiations, haggling, and considerations of opportunity cost and scarcity. Despite its challenges, barter remains a viable form of exchange in certain contexts, particularly in situations where monetary systems are weak or absent.</p>

            <p>The relationship between capitalism and various social structures has been extensively analyzed in economic anthropology. Capitalism is often contrasted with other modes of production, such as feudalism and socialism, and is characterized by private property, wage labor, and market exchange. The rise of capitalism has been linked to the development of global markets and the spread of industrialization. However, capitalism also faces critiques, particularly from feminist and Marxist perspectives, which highlight issues of inequality, exploitation, and the commodification of social relations. The interplay between capitalism and other social structures, such as religion and ethnicity, further complicates its impact on societies, leading to diverse outcomes in different cultural and historical contexts.</p>

            <p>Barthes's discussion of literature and knowledge is also of interest to Wood's discussion and of use to mine for its account of the relationship between knowledge, literature and life: his claim that 'Organized or systematic knowledge is crude, life is subtle, and it is for the correction of this disparity that literature matters to us' (2005: 40). This is a statement that brings us to the second question from which we started, the question of the value of literature to a philosophical understanding of time. If we understand philosophy to be one such crude knowledge, incapable in its crude, organised ways, of understanding the subtlety of life, we find ourselves acknowledging the superiority of literature over philosophy as a form of knowledge of the world.</p>
        </details>
        <p>But there is a paradox here insofar as this formula simultaneously asserts and denies the value of literature to philosophy: if literature lies in the middle between the crudity of philosophy and the subtlety of life it will be, on one hand, a more subtle form of knowledge of life than can be achieved in systematic thought and on the other, a relatively crude copy of the subtlety of life. Literature may provide, for example, a case study in internal time-consciousness, but philosophy would be better to deal directly with life itself, where the full subtlety of internal time-consciousness can be encountered undistorted by the demands of verbal representation. <strong>The value of literature to philosophy depends upon whether we view literature as the subject or the object of knowledge, that is, as a form of knowledge of life, or as an object which knowledge might try to understand or describe, the knower or the known.</strong> Let us suppose for a moment that the novel is superior to philosophy when it comes to knowledge of internal time-consciousness, that it can capture something which escapes systematic knowledge, or that it takes up where philosophy leaves off. The disparity between the knowing subject (the novel) and the object known (interiority) is not so great, according to Barthes's view, as that between philosophy and the mind. How then are we to know what it is that the novel knows about internal time-consciousness? In order to draw the novel's knowledge of life into the light, or to return to Wood's metaphor, in order to give voice to the unspoken knowledge that the novel possesses about time, we require a discourse about literature, or a knowledge of literature. Whether we call this knowledge philosophy, criticism or theory, the gap between this organised and systematic knowledge and the subtlety of life is encountered again in the gap between systematic knowledge and literature. Presumably, however, the gap is less wide, so that knowledge of literature will take us some way towards knowledge of life. And this, for Barthes, is why literature matters to us: it is a stepping stone by way of which philosophy can reach out towards a comprehension of life's subtleties.</p>

            <p>Though it may be music to the ears of creative writing students everywhere, this model of the relationship between philosophical knowledge of time and fictional knowledge of time is problematic in many ways, many of which are concerned with the ambiguities of the concept of knowledge itself, and the difficulties of viewing representation as a form of knowledge. Nor is the tension between philosophical and fictional knowledge of time in any way new, dominating as it has the critical and philosophical engagement with Proust and the analysis of Mrs Dalloway. I would like to address these old questions to more recent novels, to Ali Smith's The Accidental and Ian McEwan's Saturday, which serve as interesting examples in which the problems of knowledge, fictional knowledge of internal time-consciousness, and critical knowledge of this fictional knowledge, interact with each other.</p>

            <p>An irony in what was happening is that my standpoint, though different than the mainstream view, embraced polysemy. It was fine by me for good scholars to do formal analysis through the theoretical lenses of conceptual change supported by methodological positivism. Yet, others' adherence to monosemy led them to view my standpoint as incorrect, a misconception that needed correction! To be accepted in most peer review contexts I would have to change my ways of thinking and doing or pay the price for my difference. The combined impacts of conceptual change and positivism on research in science education have been totalizing, saturating sensibilities to the extent that to raise alternatives has been difficult in terms of risking rejection and marginalization. Yet, even within the dominant paradigms there is now a realization of a need for change. David Treagust and Reinders Duit (2008), two of the leading proponents of conceptual change theory, noted that certain limitations of the constructivist ideas of the 1980s and early 1990s led to their merger with social constructivist and social cultural orientations that more recently resulted in recommendations to employ multi-perspective epistemological frameworks in order to adequately address the complex process of learning.</p>

        <p><strong>One of the early pioneers of conceptual change theory in science education was Peter Hewson, a nuclear physicist who turned to science education.</strong> Hewson noted: My physics background gave me a view of the world that stressed the importance of unique, exact, confined, causal accounts of natural phenomena. Initially I did not see that this needed to be adjusted when I stopped focusing on atoms and nuclei, and turned my attention to a student learning physics. While I knew there was a context in which people learned, the notion of an isolated system was a conceptual device for effectively ignoring it. In time, however, the limitations of trying to identify unique causes became apparent, and I came to appreciate the complexity of factors that influence learning, and their interactional nature. While there clearly is an individual, cognitive character to our learning, we are also social, cultural, affective creatures who respond to those around us in a variety of ways that are strongly influential of the questions we ask, the opinions we espouse, and the understandings we create.</p>

            <p>I maintain that a fertile approach to research in science education is grounded in the adoption of a fresh theoretical framework for learning and doing science. I use theory in the spirit of Karl Popper (1974) that our theories are our inventions; but they may be ill-reasoned guesses, bold conjectures, hypotheses. Out of these we create a world: not the real world, but our own nets in which we try to catch the real world. I argue that tinkering with the dominant ideology does not offer the fertile insights needed in science education. In making a case for change I am not arguing for a new way to replace the old. My stance is in opposition to the idea that there is a correct way to see the world, to interpret the work of others, and to apply theory to science education. I am arguing for polysemy. Accepting Difference Adherence to monosemy, an ontological stance, may be at the root of a dire problem in science education. As I mentioned in the previous section, my polysemic stance supports a multilogical foundation for science education. In contrast, monosemy can motivate moves toward assimilation; a one-size-fits-all approach to science education with winners and losers, oppressors and oppressed. This has been the status quo during my career as a science educator.</p>

            <p>Initially we thought of the field more as a pasture with a porous border. The concept of weak boundary, as distinct from strong boundary, had implications for method as we began to look within fields for culture that did not belong there. For example, in schools we observed that street culture was enacted to the detriment of students seeking to become educated as a means for social advancement. Theorizing a border shone light on transitions and comparisons between those who were close to the border and those who were immersed 'deep' in the field. Of course questions also arose about what constituted a boundary. We decided that boundaries were structures, in which case there was no need to regard boundaries as separate entities. This realization led us to see the parallels between social fields and those from physics, such as in electric, magnetic, and gravitational fields. The possibilities began to excite us as we were suddenly freed from a reluctant tendency to relate fields to particular times and spaces. Freed from this restraint we were able to allow fields to move freely with individuals through space and time. Hence, border crossing became a phenomenon that was no longer salient in our research since there were no borders. The situation of street culture entering the school then invited a different way of doing research on the issue and the possibility of solving such problems in very different ways, perhaps through the lenses of creating and legitimizing interstitial cultures. Also, the dialectical relationship that constitutes macro-, meso-, and micro-lifeworlds could be explored quite differently because it was now clear that at any time and in any space individuals could be involved in activities in multiple fields. As our theoretical perspectives evolved, so too did the research foci and methods used in our studies. From what I have said it is easy to see that lags will occur and it might be inferred that I am arguing for temporal ordering whereby a change in focus causes a change in method. Such an inference is not implied and I regard it as a dangerous stance. Method and focus presuppose each other and there is no temporal imperative. In fact changes in method can elicit fresh theoretical perspectives and new research foci.</p>

        <p>For as long as I have been a science educator, psychological models have been the mainstay of theory supporting science education. During my days as a high school science teacher my theories mainly were tacit. I had a sense of students needing to engage and stay focused in order to learn. I also knew that through their efforts they could learn from me and from their peers. Later I learned about the psychology of Piaget, when I became a curriculum designer who wrote teachers' guides and students' workbooks. Having such an emphasis meant that the activities we recommended for teachers were intended to get students actively involved and to learn science in terms of what they knew already and were interested in learning. To a significant extent the approach emphasized the importance of individual students making sense of their experiences by resolving cognitive conflict. <strong>When I went to the University of Georgia to do my doctorate I joined one of the most behaviorist science education groups in the USA.</strong> Although the faculty members were open to the use of other frameworks for making sense of teaching, learning and curriculum, most of them were committed to behaviorist ways of thinking about education. This was especially true in regards to methodology, since most of the faculty used methods built around positivism. In required courses I had to show an understanding of and value for Julie Vargus's radical behaviorism and apply it in numerous contexts. However, when I returned to Australia and endeavored to apply radical behaviorism to my research, I had little success. To advance my research project I needed to move beyond methodological positivism and identify frameworks to illuminate teaching, learning, and learning to teach in a more productive light. I searched avidly for new ways to think about methods and especially to make sense of teaching, learning and learning to teach. I explored neo-Piagetian theories and then radical and social constructivism. Fortunately, Ernst von Glasersfeld's work in language and mathematics education seemed highly applicable to my experiences and perceptions of the pressing problems in science education. Glasersfeld's insights encouraged me to adopt radical constructivism and consider the potential applicability of other theories such as George Lakoff and Mark Johnson's work on metaphors. My understanding of theory was changing in that I regarded theorizing as akin to shining lights on experience, providing fresh perspectives and catalyzing research projects that could evolve continuously based on the adaptation and adoption of chosen theories. Also, I was learning how to not regard discarded theories as wrong. It was apparent that the use of any set of theoretical lenses illuminated certain aspects of social life while failing to discern others.</p>

            <p>I don't believe in that sort of research,' was the preamble to a question from a scholar at the back of the conference meeting room. 'The audacity of the guy,' I thought as one of Australia's most eminent scholars admonished a master's degree student who had just given his first presentation at a national conference. Like so much of the work done in my research squad in the early 1980s, this study reflected a transition toward ethnography, from process product research that explored teacher and student variables in relation to one another, students' perceptions of the learning environment, and science achievement. Though I did not realize it at the time, the first shot had been fired in an exchange that was to continue to the present day. Apart from the public comment being discouraging from the student's point of view, this eminent scholar's stance was imperialistic. From the east coast of Australia, he was signifying to those in attendance that our way of looking at science education was not up to par, and that such work in the future would receive public rebuke. A year or 2 earlier the signs of this first public salvo were evident in a meeting of the Australian Science Education Association (ASERA) at Macquarie University in Sydney. I had just returned from the United States, where I had done my doctorate in science education. I was involved in my first meeting of ASERA and noticed the dominance of scholars from Monash University (in Eastern Australia). One of them, Peter Fensham, was the first professor of science education in Australia and his presentation to the group involved an innovative way of examining student misconceptions. The topic was concept mapping, an approach that was new to me and did not align with my current orientation to doing research on teaching and learning science and learning to teach science. Although I was an enthusiastic participant in the exercises Fensham used to introduce participants to the theory and methods, I had little inclination to use concept mapping in my research or to embrace conceptual change theory. My stance was very much in a minority and I felt I was being shown the approved way to proceed with research in science education. There seemed to be an expectation that one 'tried-and-tested' way of looking at science education was preferred and conceptual change theory was oriented in the right direction. The growing oppression I experienced in Australia did not deter me from plotting my own course and before I left for the United States in 1987 I continued to develop my own frameworks, foci, and methods. My pathway toward theory-rich, qualitative studies of teaching, learning, and learning to teach science developed in my research squad on the west coast of Australia as the conceptual change approach swept from coast to coast, becoming the predominant theoretical voice in Australian science education. What I experienced in the early 1980s in Australia was just the tip of an iceberg. Conceptual change theory was to sweep the world of science education and dominate the ways in which science educators did their work. The theory did not fit my way of looking at science teaching and teacher education and my search for appropriate theory took a path that increasingly diverged from the ones chosen by my colleagues in science education. Because my foci were different, the extent of the divergence increased with time and for the most part I only noticed it as an issue when peer review occurred.</p>

            <p>In conclusion, trade could proceed without literacy, or company organisation, or money or weights and measures, or legal contracts and procedures; the constant 'background noise' of short-hop mixed trading around the Mediterranean and into its hinterlands went on perfectly well without such institutions. However, the absence of them increased the risks of transporting large and/or valuable cargoes, of lending or borrowing money to finance voyages, of delegating authority to agents or travelling on someone else's boat, or it increased the time, effort and money involved in making an exchange. The development of widespread, regular connectivity, and of larger-scale trade, depended on the development of institutions and above all on the development of the state as consumer, underwriter of supplies and infrastructure, and establisher and guardian of law.</p>
        </details>
        <p><strong>In modern discussions of trade, the term 'market' is more likely to be used to refer to an abstract, impersonal entity, in and through which 'market forces' dominate people's lives, than to indicate a concrete place where people buy and sell goods.</strong> The idea of a 'farmers' market' may seem tautologous to many inhabitants of continental Europe, let alone to the rest of the world, but in modern Britain and the United States the phrase has become indispensable as many of the original connotations of 'market' have been overlaid and as direct encounters between producers and consumers have become rarer. The semantic shift says something about the development of modern retailing and attitudes towards it; a visit to a 'real' market is now associated with a conscious rejection of the ethos of the 'supermarket' or with the exotic experience of holidaying in countries where people still buy fresh seasonal food every morning, rather than simply being part of our daily routine. The ancient world had no conception of 'the market' in the abstract sense. Markets were familiar enough, from the fifth century if not before; indeed, there was a range of different sorts of markets, catering for different kinds of producers, consumers and goods. The tendency of prices in the market to vary was well understood, but it was not attributed to impersonal 'market forces'; on the contrary, it was seen as the direct result either of changes in supply or of the greed of individuals. The various regulations and officials introduced by states to monitor and control the markets that took place under their jurisdiction were expressly designed to make individual traders responsible for what were, in the eyes of the state and probably of many of the citizens, the consequences of their decisions; the right to make a profit was not inalienable, if this would threaten the interests of the community. The fact that the individual merchant might be wholly blameless, simply trying to recoup his costs, was not accepted as an excuse for the anti-social effects of his actions.</p>

            <p>Classical antiquity offered a range of places and occasions for buying and selling. Every city had its agora or forum, the spaces in which citizens gathered for different activities associated with civic life; stalls could be set up there when the space was not being used for other purposes, and every city had rows of shops in the streets around. The larger the city, the more elaborate its facilities; Athens had both the agora in the city and the market in the Piraeus, the 'world apart' where foreign traders and goods were to be found, ideally kept at a distance to avoid the possibility of corruption by foreign influences. Many Roman cities acquired purpose-built market halls, macella, for the retail trade of different foodstuffs. The city of Rome was large enough to have a whole range of specialised markets as well: the Forum Boarium for cattle and the Forum Holitorium for vegetables, both down towards the Tiber, the Forum Vinarium for wine, the Forum Suarium for pigs, the Forum Piscarium for fish and the Forum Cupedinus, once a market for delicacies and later a more general provisions market. Many of these may have been predominantly wholesale markets, though it was also possible to buy goods directly from the horrea, the warehouses down in the plebeian Aventine district. The emperors constructed monumental market buildings, such as the Macellum Liviae begun by Augustus, the Macellum Magnum built by Nero and Trajan's Market at the edge of the imperial Fora, which may have taken over the roles of many of the old markets as the spaces in which they were held became increasingly monumentalised. Different districts of the city probably had their own local markets, and of course there were shops and stalls everywhere.</p>

            <p>Rumble feature: the vibrating feedback mechanisms found in game controllers which afford the player physical sensations. Simulation: a system of representation which has no real-world referent. Derived from computer science and critical theory through the legacy of Baudrillard. In computer science, simulation is able to predict the behaviour of complex systems which cannot be directly observed and is now widely used alongside theory and experiment as a method for the production of knowledge. Baudrillard has argued that 'signs' no longer stand for a reality in the world but themselves constitute the world. Computer games combine these two strands of meaning insofar as they graphically represent environments which usually do not exist in the world and which are generated by the complex dynamic system of the game engine. Storyworld: an imaginary world that has internally consistent rules, belief systems and cultures to which the reader/user gives credence. Originally a literary construct but now available to us through media like cinema, television games and products like toys. Subject: the individual in discourse who is both subject to the way they are linguistically and culturally constructed as well as being the subject of the state. The subject is both active and passive, having agency as well as being acted upon.</p>
        </details>
        <p><strong>Systems theory: a method arising from a wide range of fields, including the natural sciences, organization theory and cybernetics, which emphasizes the way in which events are the product of complex webs of agents and interactors.</strong> A system emerges from the regular interaction of mutually dependent parts. Technicity: that aspect of identity expressed through the subject's relationship with technology. Particular tastes and their associated cultural networks have always been marked by particular technologies, e.g. rockers with motorbikes and mods with scooters. However, our increasingly intimate relations with and through digital media and communications technologies intensify the identity/technology interface. Technicities associated with the consumption and manipulation of digital technologies become key characteristics of the preferred subject of twenty-first-century capitalism and therefore the heterogeneity of other kinds of technicity are marginalized or excluded. Technological imaginary: discourses or statements can be understood as shaped by the 'technological imaginary' when technologies are enthusiastically embraced as a generative solution to the actual political and cultural difficulties. Nevertheless, the technological imaginary remains a very potent force; technophilia drives whole areas of government practice and economic aspiration. Technologically determined: the 'common sense' assumption that social and cultural developments are caused by technology, i.e. that contemporary cities are shaped by the motor car. More recently, the common sense view of history has been reclaimed through cyberculture and the figure of the cyborg as a way of realigning the human/machine relationship.</p>

            <p>The significance of the first trend, the growth in market share of the giant-sized club stores as against the previous distribution channel arrangements, lies in the fact that the configuration of the local market is altered to make life simpler for the foreign manufacturer. The common pattern is from small to large retail, personal to self-service, urban to suburban location, and often foreign ownership grows directly in the share of the facility itself and indirectly through the products sold there. The second example illustrates, among other things, how installation of a distant manufacturer's information technology system is likely to alter merchandising patterns beyond the retail outlet itself. To the extent that a firm can retrieve data from the point of sale, it can supply the proper amount of product to the retailer as well as possess important market information about the buying patterns of the customer population. Such efficiencies make it logical for a firm to try to install this technology wherever it sells products. This highly visible linkage between a manufacturer in North America and a marketplace in the Caribbean brings us to the next set of concerns anthropologists have recently been considering with respect to markets.</p>
        </details>
        <p><strong>Anthropologists studying markets have long considered how the type of commodity can affect the structure of trade in and in relation to the market.</strong> Others have described how trade in particular commodities is dominated by specific ethnic groups. With the introduction of a renewed methodological focus on the commodity from both cultural anthropological and world-systems or political economic approaches, and with the urging of 'multi-sited ethnography' suitable to an age in which 'global flows' are characteristic of many areas of experience, not just economic, studies of the market have themselves begun to vertically integrate, by theorising both upstream (supply chains) and downstream (the culture of demand) activities. One ambitious attempt at assimilation of these ideas into a specific research project with globalisation in mind is Theodore Bestor's Tsukiji Market sushi project. From the point of view of the world's largest fish market – 1677 stalls, 2000 categories and sub-categories of 2.8 million kilograms of seafood daily, 60,000 customers and traders daily, and about $6 billion worth of fish bought and sold annually – it is not difficult to see why Bestor describes Tsukiji as 'the focal point for thousands of distinct commodity chains' and 'a central node for the global seafood trade'. Following the bluefin tuna trade from specific harvesting locations in New England, the coast of Trafalgar, Spain, and then back to Tokyo, Bestor is able to convey a sense of the immediacy of the global dimensions for this prized fish.</p>

            <p>Bestor describes an isolated Bath, Maine, dock scene at dusk. About 20 buyers from as far south as New Jersey, half of them Japanese, crowd around three tuna extracting tiny core samples to examine the color, fingering the flesh to assess the fat content, sizing up the curve of the body to guess what the inside of each fish would look like when cut open, and checking carefully the condition of the bodies for damage from harpoons or careless handling. After a short period, the Japanese buyers return to their trucks to call Tokyo on their cell phones to get the morning prices for bluefin tuna at the Tsukiji market, which has just finished its auctions for the day. On the basis of this information, secret bids are submitted to the dock manager and the deals are closed. The fish are packed in ice and loaded in the back of trucks that head for JFK airport in New York, 'where the tuna will be air-freighted to Tokyo for sale the next day'. While Bestor offers only enticing snapshots of the supply side, his demonstration of how the inflated commercial value of the fish is determined by a set of coherent cultural expectations by traders in Tokyo, who are in turn responding to the demands of their customers. Bestor makes detailed application of Marshall Sahlins's illustration of the 'meaningful calculus of food preferences' being 'the symbolic logic which organizes demand' in the market for meat in the United States. He then relates the specifics of Japanese culinary tastes to the organisation of the market, which is not merely a mirror for what one might call the social relations of consumption, but a contributor to it.</p>

            <p>Instead, one usually finds three different uses of the term, and a feeling that on some ultimate theoretical level they are the same. They are: 1. 'values' in the sociological or philosophical sense. This is the sense in which an anthropologist might say 'seventeenth-century Hurons placed a high value on individual autonomy', or a politician might speak of 'family values'; 2. 'value' in the classic economic sense, in which one might speak of the market value of a house, food processor or ton of pig-iron; 3. 'value' in a more specific linguistic usage, particularly the structural linguistics of Ferdinand de Saussure. He argued that the meaning of a word was essentially a 'negative value', a contrast with other words in the same lexicon, as the colour 'red' is defined in contrast to 'yellow', 'blue', 'brown', 'pink'. One might call this 'value as contrast' or 'value as meaningful difference'. What would it mean to say these are all, ultimately, versions of the same thing? Presumably, several things. It would imply the existence of some kind of symbolic system that defines the world in terms of what is important, meaningful, desirable or worthwhile in it. This system of value would presumably extend to everything from feelings about what one might like to eat for breakfast to what human beings basically owe one another or how one wishes to be remembered after one is dead. And it would imply that there is a way to understand how this system translates into practice. Most anthropologists use 'value' in a way that suggests they believe such symbolic systems do exist. Most nowadays are also pretty certain that old-fashioned ways of talking about bounded 'societies' or 'cultures' are not the best way to approach the problem, that instead people negotiate their way through a variety of different 'domains' or 'regimes' of value. But beyond that, there is very little agreement as to how these are actually organised. This is too bad, because these are important questions, and many critical unresolved issues in social theory turn on the answers.</p>

        <p><strong>Value in Western economic theory The standard history of Western economic theory begins with the mercantilists and physiocrats of the early eighteenth century, then moves on to the political economy school (Adam Smith, David Ricardo, Karl Marx), but sees all of these essentially as precursors.</strong> Modern (neoclassical) economics was born from the marginal revolution of the 1870s. It is interesting that what set each of these schools apart from the others was, above all, its views on the origin of value, which over time became increasingly disembodied and subjective. Mercantilists located wealth in precious metals; physiocrats argued that since the ultimate source of value was nature, all social wealth was ultimately derived from agriculture; the political economists claimed that value was a product of human labour (in other words, that it emerged through the body, at exactly the point where our minds become a physical force in nature). For neoclassical economists it transcended the physical altogether, and became simply a subjective measure of desire. From their time on, the value of an object became increasingly indistinguishable from its price: how much potential buyers were willing to give up to acquire some product on the market. It exists only in the eye of the beholder. It is important to bear in mind that, for earlier economists, value was assumed to be different from price. People were willing to pay money for an item because they saw it as valuable for some other reason. True, prices would also fluctuate owing to the vagaries of supply and demand; but all other things being equal, the market price of a loaf of bread, it was assumed, would tend to gravitate towards what was often called its 'natural price', its inherent desirability, measured in relation to the desirability of other items. It was in this sense that value was seen as the regulative principle of prices. Economics could only free itself from such a notion when it purged itself of all moral elements; as a result, the marginal revolution really involved eliminating value from economics entirely.</p>

            <p>To understand this, consider Smith's famous statement of the so-called 'paradox of value', which he posed in explaining the distinction, originally posed by Aristotle, between value in use and value in exchange: The word value, it is to be observed, has two different meanings, and sometimes expresses the utility of some particular object, and sometimes the power of purchasing other goods which the possession of that object conveys. The one may be called 'value in use'; the other, 'value in exchange.' The things which have the greatest value in use have frequently little or no value in exchange; and, on the contrary, those which have the greatest value in exchange have frequently little or no value in use. Nothing is more useful than water: but it will purchase scarce anything; scarce anything can be had in exchange for it. A diamond, on the contrary, has scarce any value in use; but a very great quantity of other goods may frequently be had in exchange for it. (Smith 1776: 28) Now, the standard line, repeated endlessly in economic textbooks, is that Smith was unable to resolve this paradox because he lacked an adequate theory of supply and demand. His mistake was to, naively, contrast what an economist would now call the total utility, the overall usefulness, of water, with the total utility of diamonds, where he should have been looking at the marginal utility of any unit of water: since the market price of any one unit of a product is the lowest amount a potential buyer is willing to pay for it, and since most people already have access to water, the price they would be willing to pay for an additional unit is likely to be very low. It was because Smith was unable to see this that he was forced to invent the famous labour theory of value, concluding that the high price of diamonds must derive from the fact that it takes all sorts of toil and trouble to produce one, while water falls from the sky. According to the usual account, then, this mistake led economics down a series of hopeless dead ends, ranging from Ricardo's attempt to calculate the natural price of a commodity through the total number of 'man hours' that went into producing it, to pretty much the entire corpus of Marx.</p>

            <p>In an extreme form, the classic characteristics of 'economic man' are maximisation of short-term gain, autonomy, free agency and complete knowledge. As the essays in Ferber and Nelson's (1993) Beyond economic man show, there is also an assumption that the person in question is male, albeit of a rather particular type: 'a cross between Rambo and an investment banker' (McCloskey 1993: 79). As for the type of economics discussed in this chapter, 'the neoclassicals are notably butch. They are a motorcycle gang among economists, strutting about the camp with clattering matrices and rigorously fixed points, sheathed in leather, repelling affection' (1993: 77).</p>

        <p><strong>The relationship between anthropology and development has long been one fraught with difficulty, ever since Bronislaw Malinowski advocated a role for anthropologists as policy advisers to African colonial administrators and Sir Edward Evans-Pritchard urged them instead to do precisely the opposite and distance themselves from the tainted worlds of policy and 'applied' involvement (Grillo 2002).</strong> This chapter briefly introduces the concept of development and summarises the history of the relationship between development and anthropologists. Along the way, it considers three main positions which anthropologists have taken and may still take in relation to development. The first, that of antagonistic observer, is one characterised by critical distance and a basic hostility towards both the ideas of development and the motives of those who seek to promote it. The second is one of reluctant participation where institutional financial pressures and livelihood opportunities have led some anthropologists, with varying degrees of enthusiasm, to offer their professional services to policy makers and development organisations. The third is the long-standing tradition in which anthropologists have attempted to combine their community or agency-level interactions with people at the level of research with involvement with or on behalf of marginalised or poor people in the developing world. Since the emergence of the term in its current usage after the Second World War, the concept of development went on to become one of the dominant ideas of the twentieth century, embodying a set of aspirations and techniques aimed at bringing about positive change or progress in Africa, Asia, Latin America and other areas of the world. Development brings with it a set of confusing, shifting terminologies and has been prone to rapidly changing fashions. The popular demarcation of 'First World' (Western capitalist), 'Second World' (Soviet, Eastern Bloc and other socialist areas) and 'Third World' (the rest) became common during the Cold War. More recently, the still common distinction between a wealthy developed 'North' and a poor, less-developed 'South' has its origins in the UN-sponsored Brandt Commission report of 1980. The policy language of 'basic needs' in the 1970s has shifted to new paradigms of 'sustainable development' in the 1990s, alongside more recent attention to 'building civil society' and 'good governance'.</p>

            <p>The language of development, as well as its practices, has changed over time as the global context has also shifted, indicating a growing sophistication in its understanding of problems of poverty as well as perhaps a lack of confidence in some of the basic assumptions of the 'developers'. Whatever the terminology that is in vogue (the field is characterised by an ever-shifting landscape of labels, concepts and fashions), the 'development industry' remains a powerful and complex constellation of public and private agencies channelling large amounts of international development assistance, including inter-governmental organisations of the United Nations, multilateral and bilateral donors such as the World Bank or the United States Agency for International Development (USAID), and a vast array of non-governmental organisations (NGOs) ranging from small specialised, grassroots concerns to large transnational organisations such as Oxfam or the Bangladesh Rural Advancement Committee (BRAC). Relations between anthropologists and the world of development ideas and practices date from the early days of the discipline during the colonial period and have continued, in various forms, up to the present. Such relationships have encompassed the spheres of research and action, from positions of sympathetic involvement as well as the stances of disengaged critique or even outright hostility. Whatever point of view anthropologists may take about development, the concept of development, itself a diverse and highly contested term, remains one of the central organising and defining systems of our age and will therefore continue to demand anthropological attention.</p>

            <p>Engaged activists have long been anthropologists interested in using their knowledge for practical purposes. The field of applied anthropology, defined as the use of anthropological methods and ideas in practical or policy contexts, has seen anthropologists collaborate with activists, policy makers and professionals within a range of fields, including that of development. From the British colonial administration in Africa to the Office of Indian Affairs in the United States, anthropologists have involved themselves in applied work and contributed research findings to policy makers on issues such as local customs, dispute settlement and land rights. The gradual professionalisation of the development industry from the 1970s onwards led to a growth of opportunities for anthropologists to work within development agencies as staff or consultants, just as anthropologists also took up jobs within fields as diverse as community work and corporate personnel departments. In this role, anthropologists often acted as cultural translators, interpreting local realities for administrators and planners.</p>
        </details>
        <p><strong>Applied anthropologists have drawn on different aspects of anthropological thinking in the ways they have tried to contribute to development work.</strong> First, by stressing an approach which gives equal emphasis to both social and economic aspects of societal change, anthropologists have helped to counter the dominant privileging of the economic in development thinking. They have contributed to a critique of modernism and its predominantly economistic view of the world, showing for example that markets are socially embedded institutions and that the economically rational behaviour of neoclassical paradigms is tempered by pragmatism. At the methodological level, applied anthropologists have taken the open-ended, long-term participant observation tradition and tried to relate fieldwork more tightly and in a time-bound way to a set of focused research questions. An example of this is research in rural northwestern Bangladesh by Lewis, Wood and Gregory (1996), concerning an ODA aquaculture project. Through their extensive participant observation, the researchers were able to identify a complex range of hidden (to the planners) intermediaries within local fish production and marketing networks, and their findings contributed to the rethinking of objectives, away from a concern solely with production and towards a greater emphasis on rural poverty reduction.</p>

            <p>The growth of participatory paradigms in development practices has also drawn extensively on anthropological methodology, albeit with more of an emphasis on 'quick and dirty' fieldwork than many anthropologists would wish for. Applied anthropologists have also drawn attention to issues of Western bias in the assumptions that inform development initiatives, uncovering areas of cultural difference and highlighting the value of local or 'indigenous' knowledge. The growth of interest in indigenous knowledge has now been a long-standing area of engagement between anthropologists and development practitioners, with its recognition that development interventions should be informed by the systems of knowledge recognised by local people. For example, the rise of 'farming systems research' in the 1970s was informed by field-based anthropological insights into farmers' own complex understandings of their agricultural practices. More recently, Loomis (2002) has made an eloquent case, based on his research within Maori communities in New Zealand, that local ideas about resource conservation could form a sounder basis for 'sustainable development' than many of the paradigms and approaches advocated by development agencies, and so should be incorporated more fully into policy.</p>

            <p>These various factors will affect not just the quality, price, and circulation of the object, but also its meaning for us and our willingness and ability to buy it. The provisioning approach follows the path of provisioning in order to understand how the content and the meaning of goods and services are produced and how, in turn, they produce social differentiation. It also pays attention to factors such as income availability and its form (for example, cash, credit), which are significant and differentiating links throughout the various stages of the chain of provisioning. Sharing and pooling systems among individuals embedded in long-term reciprocal relationships such as those obtained in the domestic group, peer groups, informal credit circles, neighborhoods, interest groups, and the like are also important and need to be taken into account. An aspect of this perspective is that it takes into account the simultaneous provisioning of particular goods through different paths – market, state, community, domestic group – and the articulation of market and non-market regimes along each path. Indeed, most goods shift through different phases along their path and most goods and services can be obtained through market and non-market ways. The interaction between these factors will affect both the symbolic and the economic value of the goods and services available in a society. More and more, this means paying attention to globalized processes of production and circulation not only of material objects but also of people and values.</p>
        </details>
        <p>The state is often a determining factor regarding the orientation of social actors towards more or less market-led processes of provisioning. This is salient in the provisioning of public services such as caring facilities, for example. <strong>Systems of provisioning are historically grounded and power, the capacity that people or institutions have to make decisions that affect others' livelihoods, is a crucial element in the shifts and articulations along the chains of provisioning.</strong> This approach also emphasizes the political character of the production of meaning along these paths. It stresses the unequal power to create and institute particular meanings as cultural values that have wide impact. Moreover, the differential attribution of meaning and value to goods and services appears as a salient motive for discriminating among people, based on their consumption habits. This highlights the complexity and ambivalence of the meanings incorporated in goods and available to social actors as raw materials for their identity construction through consumption practices. It also stresses the relationship between the production of meaning and systems of exploitation and domination.</p>
        <details>
            <summary>다음 문단 보기</summary>
            <p>When thinking of actual practices of provisioning it is often useful to think of social actors as enmeshed in networks of provisioning. Carol Stack, in her classic All our kin (1974), gives a telling example in her description of strategies of survival in a black neighborhood in the United States. She speaks of 'domestic networks' instead of 'domestic groups', in order to show the fluidity of the social relations that surround the provisioning and final consumption of subsistence needs such as food, shelter, clothing, and care. Moreover, each path of provisioning is forged through a complex network of social relationships that branch at the points where certain options become impossible or improbable for certain social actors and where, generally, tensions and power are concentrated and differentiation takes place. From what I have said thus far, it should be clear that the provisioning approach can be summarized in terms of the following points. First, different paths for obtaining goods and services are possible, using diverse modes of provisioning (market, state, community, domestic group). People will have different opportunities regarding their access to the various paths, opportunities that may shift at certain stages along the chain and at different points in the life cycle of the individual or the domestic group involved.</p>

            <p>Royal Brown makes a similarly valuable point, with similar overemphasis. For if, on the one level, the cultural mythification via the merger of the music and visuals into the narrative can blind and deafen the viewer/listener to the existence of the filmic images as such within history while creating a pseudohistory with which the viewer/listener is encouraged to identify, the film/music interaction can... aesthetically create the presence of a broader, noncultural mythology that roundly negates the entire patriarchal belief in a scientific empiricism that holds physical space, chronological/linear time, and history/causality as absolute truths. By assuming 'entire patriarchal beliefs' Brown is invoking the absolutes he condemns, and in doing so he diminishes his argument. 'Audiovisual dissonance is merely the inverse of convention, and thus pays homage to it, imprisoning us in a binary logic that has only remotely to do with how cinema works.' Must all be withering parallelism or revolutionary opposition? Staunch advocacy, as well as reading against the grain, are extremely important, but both have their dangers. Stuart Hall warns against the pendulum swing from naive assumptions of 'necessary correspondence' to the equally totalizing 'necessarily no correspondence,' reminding us that one isn't any more helpful than the other, even if it is more fashionable. Reading against the grain, with respect to film sound or family relations, should presuppose an awareness of the generating grain, as well as all the unexpected surfaces and depths that we don't see.</p>
        </details>
        <p>My point is that there is much more to film music, and to meaning in general, than simply parallelism and perpendicularity. If the former is congruent, and the latter at a ninety-degree angle to that congruent line, then musical counterpoint shifts from concord to opposition and back again, and covers the entire intervening space as well. If we use musical counterpoint as a figure for the way sound and music function in film, we must consider this in-between territory. <strong>Meaning in music is multifarious and difficult to pin down.</strong> This being the case, simple parallels and oppositions become nearly impossible, and not even particularly desirable. Parallel and perpendicular, tonal concord and counterpoint have not always been so polar. R. O. Morris speaks of rhythmic independence and tonal fluidity in sixteenth-century harmonic practice. To illustrate he uses the metaphor of several people, each standing for a melodic line, walking abreast; pace and distance may vary, but they are still out together. Wilfrid Mellers summarizes. Concord is the basis of 16th century harmony, discord is a momentary disturbance before the concord's repose; we can never consider any discord in isolation but only in relation to the context which it appears in, for it is not a self-contained entity but part of the progressive evolution of a number of equally important lines. Musical counterpoint does not oppose without coming together. Fugue is the superlatively contrapuntal musical form, in which an idea is followed by a counter-idea, the subject by counter-subjects.</p>

            <p>This terminology is most montagelike, and indeed classic montage principles would seem to be inscribed within fugal structure, at least as stated here. But there are alternative views. And counterpoint in its traditional tonal setting is full of consonance. Statements are followed by elaborations, but musical themes are returned to again and again, as without them the structure breaks down. Interestingly the tonal, affirmative parts of counterpoint are part of film, and classical film theory as well. We just do not hear as much about them. Eisenstein, writing well after the Statement, expressed his admiration for the 'sound and sight consonance' in Disney's 'wonderful' Snow White. In addition to montage opposition, as well as the non-synchronization of sound and image, Eisenstein would later find substantial spaces for concord, and even parallelism. Given some of Eisenstein's earlier polemical excesses, it seems surprising to hear him praise musical equivalencies. Equivalency and textual unity are not only or always repressive measures, however, and in fact the unity that informs the present study draws on the almost Blakeian transcendence of later Eisenstein. His many disappointments leaving him not just battered, but extremely philosophical, he seems to come in the end to a surprising and simple conclusion. No matter how far afield one's points of reference, everything is, in the end, connected. Music, especially contrapuntal music, is not really reducible to simple montage equations. It is not only that excessive correspondence between image and music ignores 'undertones of meaning'; the same is true when we excessively assume, in 'counterpoint,' uncorrespondence. 'Too often homology spells tautology, and contrast contradiction.'</p>

            <p>The emergence of the festival in the somewhat Dickensian form we now recognise it in English-speaking countries – incorporating a Christmas tree from the German tradition, the filling of stockings from the Dutch, Santa Claus from the US and the Christmas card from the British – coincides with a period of massive industrialisation, commercialisation and urgent discussions over the continued significance (or otherwise) of religion in society. According to Miller and many of his contributors, modern Christmas simply could not exist without an intimate connection with materialism, but this does not mean that we have to see this mixture of ritual (and, at least implicitly, religion) with economic values as a fall from grace in relation to some putative golden age of ascetic altruism. As James Carrier points out in his contribution on the American Christmas, this festival can be seen as one where apparently anonymous commodities are transformed by people into socially implicated gifts. Christmas shopping is not usually a casual affair, but is an intense activity in which the effortful choices and expenditures help create a sphere of family love in the midst of the world of money.</p>

        <p>Ethnic identity offers the individual a sense of belonging and contributes to group cohesion, while ethnic organization serves the mundane interests of its members (or at least its leadership). It is therefore uncontroversial to state that ethnicity has an important economic dimension, even if the bulk of recent research in the field has been concerned with processes of identification and identity politics rather than economic processes. <strong>The economic aspects of ethnicity are diverse, and range from occupational differentiation in poly-ethnic societies and entrepreneurship in ethnic networks to transnational economies connecting members of the same group living in different countries, indigenous forms of subsistence encapsulated by capitalist economies, and formal as well as informal forms of ethnic hierarchy.</strong> Upon encountering economic systems where there is an observable differentiation along ethnic lines, two explanations are typically invoked. First, the ethnic differences may be seen as a result of cultural differences, in that each group possesses certain cultural resources making its members particularly well equipped to undertake particular forms of economic activity by choice, by tradition or both. Second, the differences may also be seen as a result of structural factors, such as systematic power differences, that channel the economic activities of different groups in certain ways, for example by denying members of particular groups access to the higher echelons of business or public administration. Although this distinction may sometimes have analytic value, it is often difficult to maintain a contrast between structural and cultural explanations, as they reinforce each other. As the examples below will show, the two kinds of explanation should be seen as complementary. Moreover, it can be useful to distinguish between analytic perspectives emphasizing individual agency and systemic processes, respectively. Again, though, while empirical studies tend to privilege one over the other in practice, these should be seen as complementary perspectives rather than irreconcilable opposites.</p>

            <p>Some relevant elements of ethnicity Ethnicity appears whenever there is an ongoing, conventionalized relationship between individuals who conceive of themselves as belonging to culturally distinctive groups with different origins. The social importance of ethnicity may vary from nearly nothing to nearly everything. In North America, for example, many citizens of European descent claim allegiance to ethnic identities – Italian, Swedish, Ukrainian and the like – that have little importance in their everyday life. Economically, they participate in the greater society on a par with everybody else. It may be useful to distinguish between four degrees of ethnic incorporation. Following Handelman (1977), ethnic categories exist whenever people conventionally distinguish one another on the basis of imputed cultural or 'racial' characteristics. Ethnic networks exist whenever certain coveted resources flow between members of the ethnic category, but not outside its boundaries. Ethnic associations exist whenever the ethnic category is formally or informally organized and has a recognized leadership. Finally, ethnic communities are territorially based and thus offer their members a wide array of resources, ranging from jobs and housing to ontological security. The cultural differences which form the basis of ethnic classification are not necessarily objective, but they are intersubjectively recognized; that is to say, people generally believe in them. These notions need not be shared both by insiders and outsiders; indeed, members of the group in question often have different ideas about their cultural specifics than outsiders. For instance, people who see themselves as true believers may well be regarded as superstitious by others. More pertinently to the issue of economics, people who see themselves as taking family responsibilities seriously may be seen as nepotists by others. Mutual stereotypes, simplistic and often pejorative views of others' characteristics, contribute to maintaining ethnic boundaries.</p>

            <p>Some anthropologists select the ideas, processes and institutions of development as their field of study, but such work has tended to be highly suspicious, if not frankly critical, in its approach. At one level, anthropological work on development has flowed seamlessly from many anthropologists' long-standing concerns with the social and cultural effects of economic change in the less-developed areas of the world. Such work has shown how the incorporation of local communities into wider capitalist relations of production and exchange has profound implications for both. For example, Wilson's work in Zambia in the late 1930s showed the ways in which industrialisation and urbanisation processes were structured by colonial policies that discouraged permanent settlement and led to social instability, as massive levels of male migration took place back and forth between rural and urban areas. Long's 'actor-oriented' work in Peru explored local, small-scale processes of growth, entrepreneurialism and diversification in an area for which the dependency theorists might have argued that there would only be stagnation, challenging macro-level structural analyses by focusing on the complexity and dynamism of people's own strategies and struggles. Updating such approaches to understanding social and economic change, Arce and Long make the case for the role of the anthropologist as furthering understanding of the 'localised modernities' through ethnographic study of the ways in which dominant development processes are fragmented, reinterpreted and embedded.</p>
        </details>
        <p><strong>A more explicit area of anthropological analysis in relation to development has been research on the performance of development projects, by studying the ways in which such projects operate within and act upon local populations.</strong> Here the dominant emphasis has been to understand the reasons why they 'fail', with few studies bothering to examine why some projects 'succeed'. A classic study of this kind was Barnett's (1977) analysis of the Gezira land-leasing scheme in Sudan introduced by the British in the 1920s, which aimed to control local labour and secure cotton exports. The study found that the paternalistic structure of the intervention led to stagnation and dependency, since there were no incentives for farmers to innovate. Another key theme within anthropological work has been the gendered character of outsiders' understandings of productive relations and intra-household processes. For example, Rogers (1980) set out the patriarchal assumptions brought by development planners to the design and implementation of development interventions, such as the skewed emphasis on the nuclear family structures in contexts where extended families are the norm, or an engagement only with male farmers or household heads to the exclusion of women's roles in production and decision making. Finally, in another influential study, Mamdani (1972) laid bare the gulf which existed between the outsiders' assumptions and local peoples' priorities, when he analysed the failure of a family-planning project in India. This failure was believed by planners to be the result of people's ignorance of the advantages of smaller families and of family-planning techniques, but Mamdani showed that in reality it was the outcome of strong incentives among the poor to maintain high fertility levels, since large families were given high cultural and economic value.</p>

            <p>The focus within these kinds of anthropological studies has mainly been on the so-called 'beneficiaries' of development assistance, and in general there has been rather less anthropological work undertaken on the internal organisation and workings of the aid industry itself. Research on the so-called 'developers' who seek to bring change to local populations, though less plentiful, has nevertheless proved a fertile and instructive field of study when it has been carried out. A recurring theme has been the ways in which encounters between outside officials and local communities are structured by 'top-down' hierarchies of power and authority. For instance, Robertson (1984) examined the relations between local people and bureaucrats and focused particularly on the state, providing an anthropological critique of the theory and practice of planning. The well-known work of Chambers (1983), though not himself an anthropologist by training, on power and participation in development has also been concerned with relations between people and professionals, and Chambers has gone on to develop this theme and challenge conventional development policy and training assumptions at the levels of both theory and practice.</p>

            <p>Recourse to fan practices as our model for gameplay, whilst useful for reminding us of the range and potential of media consumption practices, is still not quite adequate for understanding the specificity of computer games. The computer-based nature of computer games continues to encourage intervention with both software and hardware. New media consumption generally, and digital games playing specifically, allows for the emergence of highly visible participatory cultures, where there is a collapse of distinction between the dominant culture (the games industry) and the subculture (games players, modders and skinners) not typically associated with cinema-going or television viewing. As Jenkins (2003b) notes, we very rarely get to hear about subcultural fan-based activities until they receive coverage in the traditional media. The highly successful game Doom (1993) is a good example of the ways in which the participatory nature of computer games and the manipulability of the software facilitates new forms of creative consumption. The publishers id Software produced a game editor and made game file formats for the game's design freely available, encouraging players to modify levels, add new enemies or construct new levels (or 'maps') themselves. Influential new media theorist Lev Manovich argues that: ... hacking and adding to the game became its essential part, with new levels widely available on the Internet for anybody to download. Here was a new cultural economy which transcended the usual relationship between producers and consumers [...] the producers define the basic structure of an object, and release few examples and the tools to allow the consumers to build their own versions, shared with other consumers. (Manovich 1998)</p>

        <p><strong>Cultural Studies has in many ways been formed as a discipline in the debate between the celebration of audiences' active meaning making through consumption and certain anxieties about the ideological significance of such activities.</strong> It is within the field of fan studies that this debate comes into sharp focus. Hills has rightly questioned the privileging of fan practices as a site of critical cultural production: 'the intense attachments of fans cannot be assumed to resist or transcend commodification; online fan practices... are complicit with the commodity-text, functioning within the dialectic of value as an intensification rather than transcendence of commodification' (2002: 179). Whilst it is important to view these practices as sites of potential power struggle, this must always be couched in a full understanding that what in one context is 'resistance' in another can become 'incorporation' (Storey 2000: 58). Jenkins, however, argues that the new 'interactive audience' challenges the binary between 'resistance' and 'incorporation' by requiring participation and production: The old rhetoric of opposition and cooptation assumed a world where consumers had little direct power to shape media content and where there were enormous barriers to entry into the marketplace, whereas the new digital environment expands their power to archive, annotate, appropriate, and recirculate media products. (Jenkins 2002, online)</p>

            <p>Despite the opportunities afforded by 'the new digital environment', we will argue that they depend upon a facility for digital means of accessing, altering and disseminating symbolic texts for further consumption. This facility affords the prosumer (the consumer as producer) symbolic wealth in the form of status and recognition, and also in a number of critical cases leads on to economic status and power within the capitalist economy. However, it is important not to overlook the highly gendered nature of the communities that form around these prosumer practices. Female players have often been actively or symbolically excluded; this is as true of the original hacker communities (as we shall see in Chapter 4) as it is of contemporary hard-core modding communities that have formed around online computer game playing. Nor is gender the only axis of power which conditions the accessibility of the necessary skills and techniques needed to be granted status within these communities. Ethnicity and class have their role to play in who gets to play with all the great new digital 'toys'. These power relations are not monolithic, however, and are as subject to processes of critique, resistance and subversion as those that exist in any aspect of culture (as we shall see in Chapter 4 and Chapter 7).</p>

            <p>Indeed, since the 1960s many New Agers and related followers of new religious movements have moved away from their antagonistic attitude to the capitalistic mainstream. Sanyasins, followers of Bhagwan Shree Rajneesh, have even become involved in developing specialist training seminars for companies such as IBM. The important point from an anthropological perspective is that we do not automatically condemn religious movements that combine spirituality with prosperity-seeking as by definition 'inauthentic'. Western culture contains within it many ideological subdivisions, some of which do not necessarily regard money as the root of all evil. The latter is an attitude that derives in part from dire New Testament warnings about the corruptions of wealth and the purity of poverty; yet, we should not regard the partial and idealised admonitions of a single religious system as the norm for all forms of religion and spirituality.</p>

        <p><strong>Some years ago, I read an article about a Japanese department store.</strong> Apparently, the management had cottoned on to the potential of Christmas as an opportunity to sell more goods, and so they had decided to promote it within their store, despite its Christian associations. As a symbol of the festival, the managers pinned what they assumed would be an appropriate statue on a wall: a figure of Father Christmas, crucified on a cross. It is easy to make fun of this example and to regard it as a silly misunderstanding of Western culture. One response to such thinking might be to point out that most people in the West would be unlikely to do much better if required to explain the central symbols of Japanese religious festivals. More importantly, however, the example points to an interesting cultural phenomenon: the globalisation of Christmas, and its apparent removal from Christian contexts and recontextualisation in contexts of market consumerism.</p>

            <p>I have chosen Christmas as the main theme of this short concluding section precisely because it offers this juxtaposition of religion and the market. Often people tell each other that 'It's all so commercial nowadays', or 'People don't seem to understand the true meaning of Christmas anymore'. Whatever our responses to such claims might be, we can be sure of the fact that Christmas is a hugely popular event at a time when ritual and religion, at least according to a certain Weberian perspective, should be on the wane. Such issues are raised in a volume edited by the economic anthropologist Daniel Miller, in which contributors discuss the ways in which Christmas is celebrated in very different cultural contexts. One of the first points made by Miller is a deeply intriguing one: that Christmas appears not to have been a particularly important part of national consciousness in the West until the nineteenth century: indeed, the Puritans had been opposed to its celebration.</p>

            <p>Forager food-sharing: Some foragers live in small camps, and acquire undomesticated species for use. There are usually between twenty and forty people resident in the camp, along with several visitors. These people include infants, children, women and men, some of whom may be sick or incapacitated. A hunter, or a hunting party, will often consume the meat of small animals on the spot where they are killed. On the other hand, should a large animal be killed, the procedures are quite different. The meat from large animals is shared with all members of the camp. Typically, the carcass is butchered into large segments at the kill site and carried back to the camp. The large segments of the carcass are then cut into smaller pieces by one person who is responsible for the job (who may or may not be the person credited with the kill). Once cut, the pieces are moved in such a way that everybody in camp gets a piece. And the rule is that everybody gets an equivalent piece. Moreover, everybody is entitled to an opinion about whether or not their piece, or their neighbour's piece, is the right size. These opinions can be voiced loudly and insistently, and they must be taken seriously. The hunters are almost always male and almost always in the prime of life. Children, pregnant women and the feeble old do not hunt and are not responsible for butchering and allocation. It must be the case that a male starts as a non-hunter, becomes a hunter as he matures, and then (if he lives long enough) ceases with advancing age to be an active hunter. Therefore, those who kill large animals are never from all the categories of person in a camp, have been non-hunters in the past and are potentially non-hunters in the future. And remember that, because shares are equal, the person credited with the kill does not receive any more meat than anybody else (and may in fact receive less; Hawkes 2001). It should be clear that meat sharing in foraging societies is a case of one-way economic transfer, not of exchange. There are categories of person (females, in this case) who have rights to receive this meat and who would never be in a position to be the hunter of meat. There is so far no sign of systematic exchange of something other than meat with a hunter. There is no sign of a delayed return, of meat or of anything else. It fits the picture: A (the butcher) moves X (meat) to all others in camp, and nothing of economic content comes back in a linked transaction. The meat has economic content, and the allocation of the meat is a one-way transfer, not an exchange.</p>

        <p><strong>Inheritance: In agrarian and industrial economies there can be considerable economic assets which are held as property by individuals.</strong> Some of these assets are transferred to living persons upon the death of the owner. Objects that can be devolved include land, facilities (for example, mines or factories), buildings, domesticated animals (horses, camels, sheep, and so on), household furnishings (furniture, pictures), jewellery, equity instruments (stocks, bonds) and cash. In these cases A is the owner of the objects, X are the objects with economic content, and upon the death of A they become the property of B (or a set of Bs). There are usually formal public rules about how the estate of the deceased is to be partitioned. Wives, children or siblings may be privileged, and many of the participants think that at least some of the assets should be channelled to the 'rightful heirs' rather than given away to 'strangers'. The estate may be held together, or it may be split into equal, or unequal, parts. In this case, there are objects with economic content that are shifted from A to B, but there is no counter-shift of objects with economic content from B to A. B is designated as a (potential or legal) recipient because of general rules (about, for example, kinship and marriage). B is not usually a recipient because of prior economic interaction with A. One may, in fact, inherit from some distant relative one has never even met. I conclude that inheritance is not an economic exchange. It may involve substantial assets with economic content. Once inherited the assets become the personal property of the heirs. Inheritance is therefore a one-way economic transfer (usually an inter-generational one), not an economic exchange.</p>

            <p>Endowments: Old-World agrarian states from India to Europe have endowments, often owned by foundations. These are based upon assets or bundles of assets, given by a person or a family. The assets are legally separated from the donor and given in perpetuity to another social entity, such as a church, temple or college. This second social entity now owns the assets, and is supposed to manage the assets to accomplish the purposes of the donors. These purposes can include charity, education, research, support of a charitable institution, and performance of ritual, including saying prayers for the souls of the departed.</p>

            <p>This aspect of computer game cultures offers a very significant limit case which affords us empirical evidence into the shifting relationships between media producers and consumers at the beginning of the twenty-first century. Cultural and Media Studies' conceptualization of audiences has travelled a 30-year path from spectatorship, through active audience theory, to the model of participatory audiences established through studies of fan cultures. The dissemination of digital media communication has offered media audiences a wide variety of participatory social spaces and sites for producerly activities. These activities were first identified by the tradition of Computer Media Communications study. Lister et al. extend this work into theorizing the shift to productive possibility occasioned by the web. Every message to a bulletin board or conversation in a chat room, every homepage or downloaded MP3 home music compilation facilitates the individual communicating in a pseudo – public sphere mode of address. What is clear is that a great deal of web use facilitates a feeling of participation in media space. In this reading, the increasingly interactive audience is constructed as being part of an ever more intimate feedback loop with media producers. Just as the interactive author has to give away complete textual control to the interactor, so media industries at large recognize that consumers' participation in the 'intermedial' landscape must inform their own production processes.</p>
        </details>
        <p><strong>The understanding of media audiences as having a 'configurative' relationship with media texts of all kinds, developed by Moulthrop and others, is a claim that is fast becoming a central quality of the discourse of new media.</strong> The Jenkins quotation at the start of this chapter represents an influential and typical position that argues for new media 'opening up' as we are enabled to 'archive, annotate, appropriate, and recirculate media products'. One way to understand this new agency of the media consumer is through recourse to play theory as a model for audience/text relationships. That is to say, to return to the use of Winnicott made by Silverstone and Hills, in which fan engagements with media worlds, far from representing an unhealthy retreat from social subjectivity 'can be theorised as a form of good health'. This is a compellingly seductive position in many respects – however, we would want to hold onto the context of political economy in order to understand it fully. Corporate media's new 'embrace' of playful fan cultures can also be seen as an extension of the business practice of '360 degree marketing' and 'just-in-time' management techniques, in which enterprises strive to be constantly in touch with consumer behaviour in order to inform production and marketing decisions.</p>

            <p>These business practices were reflected in books like Hagel and Armstrong's Net Gain, which sought to teach business leaders how to use the web not just for e-commerce, but to build 'communities' around specific brands through drawing consumers into 'sticky' websites. Moreover, as we shall see, the 'co-creative' activities of game communities require a fairly advanced level of technical skill; we have also therefore to ask what kinds of 'technicities' are being exercised here? If we go to co-creative media processes looking for diversity, inclusion and innovation, then we need to develop a critical language that goes beyond the mere celebration of fan communities and enables us to make specific distinctions between different kinds of interventions. Aspiration, tributes and tactics. In 2001, one of the main industry gatherings, the Game Developers Conference, gave the game Counterstrike its Rookie Studio Award and its Game Spotlight Award. The game has sold over a million copies despite always being available as a legally free download; it has spawned a huge online user community since its release in 2000. Counterstrike is a team-based terrorist/counter-terrorist game with a real world referentiality that sets it apart from some of the other more fantastic or sci-fi FPS games. However, the notable aspect of Counterstrike is that it was produced not by a major games studio, but by a group of 'player creators'.</p>

            <p>The Problem of Reification. It only seems like good citizenship to avow polysemy, however, a scholar's practices may reify her perspective over others, not just in her field of specialization but also in the larger field of educational research. Reification produces tacit monosemy, where a standpoint is regarded as correct and others are seen as inferior and in need of change. To admonish a field for being other is to enact monosemy—albeit in a context of avowal of polysemy. It is a paradox that we can reject conceptual change research because it does not meet the challenge of taking account of social and cultural phenomena and then assert that when it comes to this social theory or that one, the others have got it wrong. Of course, this is a gloss. The crucial issues are not so much conceptual change theory and sociocultural theory but monosemy and polysemy. Researchers can be free to pursue their own agenda and should give the same rights to others—as long as what they do is ethical and contribute to attaining the motives of the science education field. In acknowledging our frameworks as viable for our projects we must not insist that others become like us—assimilation can be grounds for cosmopolitanism, in which case the inevitable feelings of social violence that go with colonization should not be ignored. In the spirit of Derrida's cities of refuge we must make others welcome and show them the respect of listening and learning from them. To allow them to participate in a field, and then to ignore them is tantamount to exclusion. To insist on one reified standpoint may qualify as indoctrination and produce determinism (such as the insidious achievement gaps that seem to persist despite mainstream's efforts to eliminate them).</p>

        <p>On the Road Ahead. <strong>Did we participate in a dialogue in the recent special issue of Cultural Studies of Science Education (Volume 3, Issue 2) in which we brought together conceptual change researchers and sociocultural researchers?</strong> Even though the papers often do not speak directly to one another there is no doubt that in writing each of them the others' perspectives were considered carefully in what might be regarded as ongoing dialogue. Perhaps we have the start of something that extends beyond stance taking and re-taking. The chapters comprising this book, subsequent papers published elsewhere, and papers presented at recent international conferences suggest that there is an extant, vibrant, and continuous dialogue on theorizing learning that will be productive to the field of science education. Like sociology, psychology has numerous branches, many of which endeavor to make sense of social and cultural phenomena. Blurring these boundaries has the promise of making it easier to consider theory and research from psychology in sociocultural projects. The challenge for sociocultural researchers is to find promising alternates and ask of them "what more?" It is not appropriate for us to admonish conceptual change researchers to become more like us or require them to consider our work respectfully. This is for them to decide for themselves—we give them the right to create their own standpoints and we can assure them that we will struggle to learn what we can from their formal analyses. So, what then are the grounds for progress? As I see it, we demand from others the same rights we offer. Allow us to pursue our own agenda and undertake our own formal analyses. Do not colonize our projects and when we seek funding for research in our field show respect for what we do and what we have learned from what we do. Monosemy, taking the form of reification or determinism, is a plague that can fragment solidarity within science education and oppress those who dare to be different. The challenge of our times and for our field is to build solidarity while retaining difference.</p>

            <p>Setting the Stage for the Remainder of the Book. "She's not listening to me!" Her eyes danced and a smirk appeared on her face. Frustration welled up within me, but I continued to explain what we had learned in the latest research we were doing. "She disagrees with my interpretations. But who really cares? Why had she set up the meeting? Was it to learn from me? My hunch is that the meeting was scheduled to set me right, show me the correct way to think about my work, and point out my limitations while emphasizing a superior way of knowing and doing." As the excitement drained out of my voice, my mind filled with images of scholars I greatly admired, including Mary Budd Rowe and Ernst von Glasersfeld. A characteristic they shared is that they listened, learned, and then contributed to the conversation—thereby affording my listening, learning, and adding of something more. I regard their approach as an embodiment of what Paul Ricœur (1992) referred to as a privilege of being able to join the conversation of life. Is it an elusive ideal to expect scholars to participate in a polysemic dialogue in which they learn from differences by listening, commenting on what is said, and then adding more? Whether the dialogue is written or oral, it seems not only respectful, but also the epitome of good scholarship to listen attentively and then to build on what has been said already. It is in this spirit that I exhort readers to join the conversation as they dialogue with the chapters and associated forums that comprise the remainder of this book.</p>

            <p>In chapter 18, Maria Varelas, Justin Kane, and Christine Pappas explore concept development as part of a learnerhood (a term modeled on that of neighborhood), an ecosystem of interacting entities governed by certain rules and characteristics that regulate participation and in which dialectical relationships, identity, power, and learning unfold and evolve. The authors study an urban primary-grade classroom in which spaces are co-constructed by young African American children and their white, female teacher. They consider spaces as intersections of symbolic (personal, social, ideological, political) and physical dimensions, where issues of power, hegemony, agency, structure, control, and knowledge define boundaries that are flexible and permeable. Varelas and colleagues explore how these fluid and dynamic spaces are sites of dialectics and relationships among children, teacher, materials, and ideas. The authors also consider how particular structures, expectations, pressures, and possibilities in the classroom community influence the creation of the various spaces within which children exercise their agency. Within the spaces they co-create, the authors study how children's engagements in and with science involves different, possibly non-canonical ideas, emergent, or even fragile understandings, and semi-formed concepts expressed in various modalities—including language, body expression, movement, stance, appearance, gesturing, and so forth—and forms of participation.</p>

        <p><strong>An important conundrum that the science education community faces is "why is it so difficult to bridge everyday science with school science?"</strong> Drawing upon cultural historical activity theory and pedagogy of place and critical ethnographic research methods, Edna Tan, Angela Calabrese Barton, and Miyoun Lim examine in chapter 19 students' changing participation within middle school learning science. Their findings reveal the importance of place in how and why these youth pursue science learning. We argue that one way in which place shapes their learning is in how the youth take up science as a context and a participatory tool for change. They study two interrelated kinds of changes within the classroom: crafting new forms of participation and new points on entry into the science learning community, and redefining the purpose of science activity. The authors argue that students are more agential when science is a context and when science is used as a tool in addition to serving as a goal. The students have more reasons, more impetus to participate in science because more than just the world of school science is at stake. What is at stake is their place which is not merely condensed into a physical environment but rather, who they are and who they can be. Students exhibit a greater degree of agency when they can inhabit more than the world of school science in the classroom, because when more roles and perspectives are valued, more kinds of knowledge are valued. Students therefore have more opportunities to act when they feel empowered as experts to act in pursuit of a particular outcome, be it voicing an opinion or applying scientific knowledge in an outside setting such as their out of school communities.</p>

            <p>In chapter 20, Maria Rivera Maulucci reports findings from a larger, ongoing study aimed at exploring interactions between teacher identity, teacher learning, and classroom practices in a social justice teacher education program in New York. The individual | collective dialectic indicates that individual learning presupposes collective learning and vice versa and that neither individual conceptions, stored in memory, nor the collective performance of a conception, may be reduced to the other. Thus, it is appropriate to theorize conceptions we might attribute to individuals, while recognizing the role of collective performance. Research shows science teachers bring conceptions about science, science pedagogy, how children learn, and schools that may not be in harmony with reform-based teaching methods, and may be firmly held and resistant to change. Rivera Maulucci's study explores one teacher's (Elena) journey towards becoming an urban science teacher, tracing linkages between her learning in a science methods course and during specific pedagogical interventions in elementary classrooms, and how changes in Elena's schema, resources, and practices inform her instructional goals and teaching practices.</p>

            <p>In team-based online games or tactical squad-based shooters, these choices are in a constant state of negotiation as players choose different avatars (sniper, spell caster, bow and arrow attack, etc.) for different in-game challenges. In a later development of this position, Newman argues further that the in-game character is in fact just a piece of game equipment, to recall Eskelinen's game properties: 'a set of capabilities, techniques and capacities that the player can utilize' (2004: 143). However, these pieces of equipment do not exist in a game vacuum like the tokens in a board game – they have intertextual representational lives that affect the experience of the gameplay, and certainly have a greater power in the various out of game activities of fans. These lives may be merely transmitted through the packaging of the game and their graphic representations; cut scenes are another and different way in which in-game avatars are lent extra-game characteristics, however wooden. Another category also exists – those avatars based on characters that have a completely realized form outside the game world, such as sports players or characters like James Bond or Gandalf who have a fictional life in other media. Here player choice and game experience is likely to be informed by intertextual knowledge. Who chooses to play as Gimli in The Lord of the Rings games when the more obviously heroic choices of Legolas and Aragorn are available? Here then we can observe the development of a kind of post-human drama, in which the dramatis personae are like the pieces on a chess board, each with their own mathematically controlled capabilities, placed under the control of the player in the simulation machine of the game. However, the game experience is informed in all kinds of ways by the representational characteristics of the avatars.</p>

        <p>In many ways the third framework in our analytic toolkit is the most complex, for thinking about representation is here not just about Aarseth's curse of 'visualism' (2004: 52) but about the whole process by which meaning is generated. <strong>Typically, theories of representation attempt to understand how meanings are generated in the encounter between reader and text.</strong> However, as we have already seen, the terms of reader and text are already being redefined both in New Media Studies generally and Game Studies very specifically. For Newman, attention to visual representational issues is entirely misguided: '[w]hen I say that appearances don't matter, I am certainly not talking about advertising and marketing games. What I am saying is that the pleasures of videogame play are not principally visual, but rather are kinaesthetic' (Newman 2002). And yet, issues of representation stubbornly refuse to disappear. Some games seem repeatedly to generate a great deal of writing which focuses on representation; in a general sense this is what we encounter when we meet the frequent news stories about violent game content. Two such examples are the Tomb Raider series and Grand Theft Auto series (Rockstar Games – Vice City (2002) and more recently San Andreas (2004)). As we have seen, with Tomb Raider the focus of interest has very much been on the role of the female heroine Lara Croft. In relation to Vice City and San Andreas, the focus has centred around the violent behaviours allowed by the game, especially the fact that players could use a prostitute, then rob and kill her. Representation has always been a contested field, and despite the argument that games are more kinaesthetic than representational, the politics of representation are embedded in every discussion about game violence and effects, about the marginalization of ethnic groups and women in game scenarios or the psychological pleasures of being able to act out any number of fantasy roles from alien splattering commando to vampire slayer.</p>

            <p>The conventional method within humanities fields for understanding the ways in which meaning is produced has been through the application of semiotics derived from, for example, C. S. Peirce, Saussure, Eco or Hall. However, all attempts to conclusively apply semiotics to computer-based representation encounter a similar set of problems expressed in the question, 'How are we to understand or evaluate a text that never stays the same way twice?' The interactive text is dynamic and a game engine produces a simulated environment that is constantly changing. In his seminal study of the problem in Cybertext (1997), Aarseth observed: '[t]he new [interactive digital media] consist of "interactive dynamic" elements, a fact that renders traditional semiotic models and terminology, which were developed for objects that are mostly static, useless in their present unmodified form' (1997: 26). Games theorist Gonzalo Frasca, in his influential MA thesis, attempted to adapt Peircean semiotics to account for the mutability of the digital text. However, he concedes in the end that '[w]hile I do believe that this expanded explanation of signs could bring more light on the understanding of how simulations work as representations, I do not think that a semiotic analysis would be enough to fully explain simulations and videogames' (Frasca 1999, online). (See also Myers 1991, 1999a; Aarseth 1997: 24–57.) The level of complexity for conventional semiotics is compounded by play theory: How are we to understand the 'meaning' of a game? A documentary about property development has a different quality of meaning generation to a game of Monopoly. Observations about the ideology or meaning of a game are more than likely to be met with the rejoinder, 'But it's just a game' – that's the whole point.</p>

            <p>It is difficult to identify the big frameworks that dominate current sociology as Stetsenko has done for psychology, but such a task has been attempted by leading theorists nonetheless. Randall Collins (1994) divides sociology into four sociological traditions: the conflict tradition, the rational/utilitarian tradition, the Durkheimian or consensus tradition, and the microinteractionist tradition. These divisions reflect the dominant strains of sociological theory as Collins sees them within mainstream American sociology. He groups Karl Marx, Friedrich Engels, and Max Weber into the conflict tradition and he credits this tradition with a sophisticated view of the macrostructure of society. Collins includes pragmatism, symbolic interactionism, phenomenology, ethnomethodology, and the work of Erving Goffman in the microinteractionist tradition. Within Collins' four traditions Vygotsky's legacy might fit best somewhere between the conflict tradition and the microinteractionist tradition because Vygotsky could be interpreted as Marxist microsociologist. Michael Burawoy and Eric Olin Wright (2002) describe periods in American sociology when Marxism has been completely marginalized. In fact, until the era of the Cold War American sociology almost completely ignored Marxism. Briefly during the 1960s sociologists who wanted to reject the status quo in American society as well as Communist totalitarianism rejuvenated Marxism. Burawoy and Olin Wright argue that there is a renewed effort on the part of some sociologists to bury Marxism today by discounting the importance of class analysis because they believe the category of social class is no longer relevant in contemporary society. Conversely, there are a small number of sociologists who continue to argue that class is at the core of capitalist reproduction. For example Annette Lareau and Dalton Conley (2008) recently assembled a group of sociologists around the topic of class analysis. For their part, Burawoy and Wright see many possibilities for building sociological Marxism without embracing Marxism as an ideology. Although they do believe that Marxist sociology entails a commitment to social change and social justice. Rather than simply mining Marxism for inspiring ideas Burawoy and Wright want to build the theoretical possibilities of Marxism. Many sociological analyses of labor processes and social reproduction and change borrow conceptually from Marxism without being self-consciously Marxist. One prominent example not cited by Burawoy and Wright is Arlie Hochschild's (1983) The Managed Heart. This book elaborates a theory of emotional labor that borrows directly from Marxism but does not aim to contribute to the theoretical project of Marxism so much as it aims to describe and explain a particular phenomenon. Interestingly, Burawoy and Wright do not devote sustained attention to dialectical materialism as a worldview or a method in their discussion of what they view as the core ideas of Marxism. Not surprisingly, Vygotsky is not mentioned.</p>

        <p>For a variety of reasons the Vygotsky tradition is so marginal in American sociology that it cannot be said that it constitutes a framework at all even among sociologists who are committed to Marxist class analysis. Within the sociological subfield of social psychology—not to be confused with the psychological subfield of social psychology—Vygotsky is rarely mentioned. Although sociological social psychology has borrowed from psychology on occasion it lays claim to a long, if uncertain, history of its own. Stolte and colleagues (2001) trace the history of social psychology within sociology to a textbook written in 1908 by sociologist Edward A. Ross. According to Stolte and colleagues, psychological social psychology ultimately embraced the laboratory experiment and sought to explain individual behaviors and attitudes as a function of an external reality. In contrast, sociological social psychology has been more diverse in its methodological and theoretical approach. Stolte and colleagues suggest that its primary contribution can be called sociological miniaturism. <strong>Sociological miniaturism is not a methodology or a theory but rather a way of interpreting social processes and institutions; specifically, the examination of large-scale social issues through small-scale social situations.</strong> In fact, Stolte and colleagues actually prefer the term micro-sociology rather than social psychology. Within Stetsenko's interpretation of Vygotsky the distinction between micro- and macro-levels exist purely as analytic constructions. She insists that the Marxist dialectic assumes the unity of reality and that the dialectical method does not privilege the micro- or the macro-scale of analysis for explaining one another. Thus it makes little sense in her view to talk about a small-scale social situation leading to insight about large-scale social issues because the entire activity system must be taken as a unity within which contradictions must be uncovered. Still, the notion of miniaturism captures the importance of the small-scale social situation within the dialectical method. Although the micro-scale in this tradition might be called praxis—by which I refer to social action constrained by time. As Roth and Lee (2007) point out, praxis in the Vygotskian tradition refers to the moment of real human activity whereas practices are patterns that characterize actions that can be reflected upon outside of the time demands of praxis.</p>

            <p>Two central concepts are often cited that distinguish Vygotsky's (1978) perspective on learning: (a) The notion of a zone of proximal development that conceptually draws a line around the dynamic relationship between learning and development and (b) the genetic law of cultural development that conceives the natural course of the development of culture in the individual as leading from the social to the psychological level, that is, it exists first between people as an intermental category and then within the child as an intramental category. In my own work I have argued that Valentin Voloshinov (e.g., 1973) further develops the sociocultural model using the concept of "inner speech," to explain how individuals negotiate contradictory cultural codes that have been internalized (Smardon 2004). I see this as the primary strength of the sociocultural model of the mind. Unlike American interactionism, it does not assume internalizing norms to be adaptive and unlike Freudianism it holds the power of explaining intramental conflict as an outgrowth of intermental conflict, not the inherent structure of the personality. Most importantly, the sociocultural model of the mind allows for the resolution of inner conflicts as a potential source of creativity and change. Stetsenko finds it necessary to rework and reconstruct Vygotsky's project with an eye for highlighting the underlying worldview premises of this theory.</p>

            <p>I suggest that one-way economic transfers exist in all societies, that on occasion they are of great importance for people, that they are of economic significance, that they are not economic exchanges, and that they merit much more of our attention than they have received. The reader should be aware that there has been far less attention paid to one-way economic transfers than to exchanges, and in consequence there is much less known about them. A better understanding will have to await the collection of more case studies than we now have. We have a number of partially-understood examples of one-way economic transfer, and I shall use a few of them to illustrate the phenomenon. In a subsequent section I shall suggest some dimensions that seem relevant to these examples, and begin to grope towards some generalisations.</p>

        <p>Household pooling: All humans are born helpless, none is expected to do much work before the age of four or so, and many are not expected to do much work until they have reached ten years or more. In the meantime they must be provided with liquids, food, shelter and clothing (if there is any). <strong>In the early stages of life the vast majority of humans are members of a household along with primary relatives, some of whom are adults.</strong> Everywhere the adults are supposed to provide for these helpless young. Much of what is provided has economic content, and it is needed to rear these children. (Later the older children may well contribute economically to the household.) These transactions are one-way economic transfers, not exchanges. Objects with economic content, often produced by the adults in the household, are moved to and consumed by the children. There is no move of objects with economic content back to the adults. Much later in life, when the children in the scenario of the preceding paragraph are adults, and the former adults are old and helpless, it is often the case that some of those children will be responsible for taking care of them. It is tempting to regard this as part of a (delayed) exchange, but it is in most cases wrong. In part it is wrong because not all the children are expected (or desired) to provide the goods. In many societies it is the daughters only (in one region of South Asia it is the sons' wives; see Lamb 2000) who provide the caring. If it were an exchange, then all surviving children who were recipients would be expected to be active in the care. Instead it is usually one person, and that person is usually female and is usually a daughter. I therefore conclude that the transactions are part of a social relationship, with some kinds of reciprocities built in, but are not the standard delayed economic exchange.</p>

            <p>Forager food-sharing: Some foragers live in small camps, and acquire undomesticated species for use. There are usually between twenty and forty people resident in the camp, along with several visitors. These people include infants, children, women and men, some of whom may be sick or incapacitated. A hunter, or a hunting party, will often consume the meat of small animals on the spot where they are killed. On the other hand, should a large animal be killed, the procedures are quite different. The meat from large animals is shared with all members of the camp. Typically, the carcass is butchered into large segments at the kill site and carried back to the camp. The large segments of the carcass are then cut into smaller pieces by one person who is responsible for the job (who may or may not be the person credited with the kill). Once cut, the pieces are moved in such a way that everybody in camp gets a piece. And the rule is that everybody gets an equivalent piece. Moreover, everybody is entitled to an opinion about whether or not their piece, or their neighbour's piece, is the right size. These opinions can be voiced loudly and insistently, and they must be taken seriously. The hunters are almost always male and almost always in the prime of life. Children, pregnant women and the feeble old do not hunt and are not responsible for butchering and allocation. It must be the case that a male starts as a non-hunter, becomes a hunter as he matures, and then (if he lives long enough) ceases with advancing age to be an active hunter. Therefore, those who kill large animals are never from all the categories of person in a camp, have been non-hunters in the past and are potentially non-hunters in the future. And remember that, because shares are equal, the person credited with the kill does not receive any more meat than anybody else (and may in fact receive less; Hawkes 2001). It should be clear that meat sharing in foraging societies is a case of one-way economic transfer, not of exchange. There are categories of person (females, in this case) who have rights to receive this meat and who would never be in a position to be the hunter of meat. There is so far no sign of systematic exchange of something other than meat with a hunter. There is no sign of a delayed return, of meat or of anything else. It fits the picture: A (the butcher) moves X (meat) to all others in camp, and nothing of economic content comes back in a linked transaction. The meat has economic content, and the allocation of the meat is a one-way transfer, not an exchange.</p>

            <p>It is not surprising, therefore, that postmodern scholars would find delight in the associations created by term phal-logocentrism, which points to the historically dominant influences on philosophy: male (phallus), language (logos), and logic (Gr. logos). This influence continues in the way science is practiced today, including psychology and sociology. But despite the changes in Continental philosophy in particular, research continued with the traditional in-the-head orientation that has dominated thinking about epistemology. Thus, we witnessed research that seemed to focus on cultural variation but that read like it had a psychologically oriented conceptual change orientation. That is, the individual (differential) psychological approach dominated even when researchers outwardly displayed a discourse about culture as the relevant unit for understanding knowing and learning. The orientation to and focus on learning from a psychological perspective was also observable in the, at the time most radical theoretical shift toward communities of practice and situated cognition. Typical for this orientation is the conceptualization of learning in communities of practice, which is said to occur as the individual is moving from the periphery to the core of the community. That is, the theory concerning communities of practice and the trajectory of learning with legitimate peripheral participation still focused, at least in the research realized, on the individual as the unit of analysis. The community of practice was taken as a more or less stable box with a periphery, where the cultural practices were less authentic than in its core, where the leading practitioners and the most characteristic and community-defining practices were to be found. Learning was still thought to occur in the individual thought to become competent and in so doing moving from the periphery to the core.</p>
        </details>
        <p><strong>A very different way of thinking about knowing and learning was offered in the latter part of the 1990s in a series of studies concerning the discourse found among high school students concerning knowing, learning, beliefs, epistemology, and so on.</strong> The approach was grounded in a relatively new sub-discipline of psychology that came to be known under the name of discursive psychology. The fundamental idea of this approach is to take discourse as the unit of analysis rather than the individual. The individual then is thought to realize possibilities that exist at the collective level. The need for such a shift in thinking comes from the fact that in talking, an individual student or teacher participating in a research project addresses the researcher or a research assistant. But in addressing this other person, the form and content of the discourse is automatically adjusted to the social situation and made what is—without reflection necessary—to the listener. Any stretch of discourse, therefore, is characteristic not of individual participants but of the coparticipants in the communicative effort and the type of social situations in which they take part. Thus, from this perspective it is to be expected that a conversation between a high school teacher and his student changes when it takes place in the context of a lesson that is part of their physics course or when it takes place in the context of an interview that the teacher conducts as part of his research on knowing, learning, or epistemology. Just as the introductory quote states, consciousness is a function of ideology and social interaction—and all three, consciousness, ideology, and social interaction use language as their ground, material, and tool for their realization. If a high school student talks about a hand and arm transferring a force to a baseball that a pitcher throws (a "misconception"), then, from this perspective, we ought to understand it as a shared phenomenon realized by this student but understandable by many others speaking the same language. This student merely realizes a widely recognized possibility of English to explain the flight path of a baseball. In this shift that I describe in the course of last two paragraphs, from psychology sociology (social psychology), the unit of analysis changed from the individual to culture or a cultural dimension (discourse). We can easily understand why for educators such a shift is difficult to understand and make. Whereas researchers can use a cultural lens for understanding, teachers still are confronted with the task to educate and test individual students.</p>

            <p>Even when students are allowed to learn in collaborative settings, the institutional requirement of evaluating learning at the individual level orients the endeavor of science educators to the individual. This is the case even though ways of talking are shared, so that the talk used to realize "(mis-, alternative, naïve) conceptions" constitutes a cultural possibility. This cultural possibility is not eradicated in the teaching of an individual child or student, allowing us to understand why "misconceptions" are so resistant to the endeavors of those science educators interested in eradicating them. The discourse approach provides us with an answer to a question that conceptual change researchers have been unable to provide. The foregoing suggests that to understand what students say and write we need to study culture, even though we know that it is the individual who, especially when reflexively pointing to him/herself using an indexical "I" or "me." There are other reasons why science educators may have to shift perspective to include cultural and sociological perspectives not only in their theoretical frames but also in their teaching.</p>

            <p>'Development' in its modern sense first came to official prominence when it was used by United States President Harry S Truman in 1949 as part of the rationale for post-war reconstruction in 'underdeveloped' areas of the world, based on provision of international financial assistance and modern technology transfer. Development has subsequently been strongly associated primarily with economic growth. However, there has also been a growing recognition that while the well-being of an economy may form a precondition for development it is not a sufficient one, and that attention too has to be paid to issues such as income and asset redistribution to reduce inequality, support for human rights and social welfare, and the sustainable stewardship of environmental resources. The Human Development Index developed by the United Nations Development Programme at the start of the 1990s has attempted to address such concerns, at least in part, by combining gross domestic product (GDP) per capita, life expectancy and a measure of educational attainment. However, few words offer as many definitional difficulties as 'development', and it remains a highly contested term. While dictionary definitions focus on the idea of 'a stage of growth or advancement', development remains a complex and ambiguous term which carries with it several layers of meaning.</p>
        </details>
        <p><strong>As a verb, 'development' refers to activities required to bring about change or progress, and is often linked strongly to economic growth.</strong> As an adjective, 'development' implies a standard against which different rates of progress may be compared, and it therefore takes on a subjective, judgmental element in which societies or communities are sometimes compared and then positioned at different 'stages' of an evolutionary development schema. Indeed, development is often understood in Darwinian terms as a biological metaphor for organic growth and evolution, while in a Durkheimian sense it can be associated with ideas about the increasing social, economic and political complexity in transitions from 'traditional' to 'modern' societies. At the same time, 'development' has also come to be associated with 'planned social change' and the idea of an external intervention by one group in the affairs of another. Often this is in the form of a project, as part of conscious efforts by outsiders to intervene in a 'less-developed' community or country in order to produce positive change. Finally, within radical critiques, development is viewed in terms of an organised system of power and practice which has formed part of the colonial and neo-colonial domination of poorer countries by the West.</p>

            <p>The belief in the promotion of progress arose during the period of the Enlightenment, in the eighteenth century in Northern Europe. During this period, the rise of competitive capitalism undermined prevailing relations of feudalism and ushered in a period in Western thought which emphasised rational knowledge, the rise of technology and science and the dichotomies of 'backward' and 'advanced' societies. By the colonial era, it was common for the colonisers to construct themselves as rational agents of progress, while local people were portrayed as child-like or backward. The introduction of European-style religion, education and administrative systems went hand in hand with the quest for economic gain. By the early twentieth century, the relationship between colonial administration and ideas of planned change had become more explicit, and responsibility for economic development came to be complemented by the incorporation of welfare objectives and responsibility for minimum levels of health, education and nutrition for colonial subjects.</p>

            <p>Differences in individuals and social location are inherent aspects of social life. As individuals experience sameness, they also experience and confront differences. These differences create social and cultural boundaries that arise from cultural enactments that are produced, reproduced, and transformed in a dialectical relationship. The concept of difference is also formative in that it can give rise to a matrix of boundaries formed by sociocultural and political enactment. For example, students in a science classroom can live in the same neighborhood, admire the same musical and sports heroes, and share classroom experiences, yet experience difference in age and ethnicity between their classmates and teacher, and how education policy is implemented. Above I highlight my professional experience working with out-of-school science programs throughout NYC before becoming a university level science educator in the Bronx. Throughout these two phases of my career there have been many unique opportunities to listen to and learn a significant amount about different journeys that are part of the narrative of science education in NYC. Through my numerous encounters, I have worked with many students and other science educators who have been positioned differently in social spaces. The populations of urban centers, such as the Bronx, are increasingly becoming diverse. New and diverse streams of immigrants alongside long-term residents create dynamic modes of difference that are dialectically connected with modes of sameness. The emergent modes are often reflected in science classrooms. Although past and current attempts to overcome differences are often accompanied by control-over and conformity, similar interests, such as interest in science, create the need and opportunities to build interstitial culture to create successful encounters to meet goals and motives. Interstitial forms of culture are created as individuals and communities are brought together in new and unique ways. As such, when science classes are scheduled in school buildings, students and teacher(s) are brought together and form unique circumstances to teach and learn science. Teaching and learning science in classrooms can afford the emergence of shared culture and solidarity that can be used for successful encounters across boundaries of difference.</p>
        </details>
        <p>In this manner race can activate passivity (being inscribed by others without conscious awareness) in the classroom. A Black male student participating in a classroom might act in ways that he feels as affording learning and cooperation, but unknowingly he is inscribed, by other classroom participants, as unlikely to earn high grades. In this way he might find it very hard to build social networks with classmates and the teacher to improve his chances of success. As such, it is important not to perceive others and ourselves as helpless, but in fact recognize that science teachers and students experience passivity and simultaneously act agentially to negotiate and renegotiate how science education is conducted locally and in expanded ways. Difference does not have to imply a hostile state and the necessity to assert control over the other. The emphasis instead is to look beyond dominant modes to build moral solidarity across difference. <strong>Solidarity is an affiliation and a sense of belonging together that produces synchrony (coherence in practice) and shared schema among participants in a field.</strong> It is the coming together of multiple ontologies. There are collective and individual responsibilities that are associated with the affiliation. Salient to the affiliation is a feeling that, "I will look out for you," or "I share culture with these people," and there are collective responsibilities and obligations that shape encounters between them. As such, solidarity requires the acceptance of others' culture that binds the collective together, embodied in modes that create synchrony and fluency. The evidence for synchrony might include coordinated eye contact, head movement, gestures, prosody, body orientation, overlapping speech and enactment of rituals. In this manner, rituals (or practices) such as humor, smiles, high-fives, and sharing anecdotal metaphors can aggregate and resemble an ensemble of solidarity. Accordingly, solidarity is an emergent resource created within the dialectic of the individual and collective. It is produced by the simultaneous aggregation and fluent expression of widespread positive emotional energy and synchronous ways of being, becoming, and belonging.</p>
        <details>
            <summary>다음 문단 보기</summary>
            <p>A moral solidarity can also be built around culture that encompasses sameness or difference. Cultural dispositions that are socially acquired in fields outside school, and are shared to a high degree by students can create the type of sustained interest, physical, and emotional entrainment that is critical in the development of solidarity. For example, difference can be characterized by expressive individualism. An individual can express his or her individuality and yet still belong to a collective. As such, individuals experience difference simultaneously with sameness. As described earlier difference is in a dialectical relationship with sameness. To build a moral solidarity that gives students the right to be present in the science classroom and participate, students must have the ability to identify with a group that they like and identify with the subject matter produced as a form of cultural. In addition, students must identify with success and build resources, such as accessing social networks, with what they learn to improve the quality of their lives. Often successful science lessons are not the result of a well-written curriculum or expert teacher (although both are important), but rather the product of a successful cooperation and coordination involving teachers and students. As such, a moral solidarity is important in order to build science identities and create successful encounters in science classrooms across differences. Sharing successes and failures have enabled an ongoing examination for the implication of synthesis-of-choice in addressing the emerging context of being science educators and students, particularly in the urban context. In other words, building moral solidarity increases the potential to afford new roles and responsibilities to catalyze positive change across familiar and different circumstances for teaching and learning science.</p>

            <p>Before pausing to consider the value implications of each of these kinds of arrangements, we need to consider the differing relations that obtain between businesses throughout the global economy. National economies differ in the way that businesses conduct their everyday transactions: the choice that every business faces is whether to perform every phase of its production itself, or whether to buy products or services from another firm (Williamson 1981, 1985). Historically, for instance, Japanese and US firms handled this problem very differently. The large US corporations generally provided for all their production and service needs through the development of specialist corporate branches and processes. Perhaps the most famous example of this tendency was the Ford manufacturing plant at River Rouge, Michigan. At one end the plant took in raw materials like coal, iron ore and coke, and at the other end finished Ford automobiles rolled out (Lacey 1986). This model of self-sufficient production lasted until the post-war Japanese industrial revival, which relied on contracting as much of the production as possible to separate, cooperating firms. The US response was a radical restructuring of all of its major manufacturing and service industries to mirror the Japanese model (Harrison 1994). This is the basis for the so-called 'flexible' mode of production. Other societies resolve the problems of how to organise businesses differently. An example is Italy, which has handled the same organisational imperative by coordinating small firms into virtual, not actual, production lines. This 'small is beautiful' strategy has been successful over the past 25 years among industries composed of enterprises of no more than ten people that, when working in a production chain, compete successfully in international markets (Blim 1990; Piore and Sabel 1984; Whitford 2001).</p>
        </details>
        <p>What we learn from these examples is that the organisation and functioning of businesses are historically fluid. Businesses must make a profit, and international competition, especially since the world economic slowdown in the 1970s, has driven most national economies to try any number of new means of institutional arrangements, labour policies and the like to obtain a market advantage (Arrighi 1994; Brenner 1998). This increases variety in one moment, and fosters imitation in another. <strong>We live in a period of US dominance, in which the primary objective of US foreign policy appears to be to encourage harmonisation of economic policies worldwide around free markets and free trade.</strong> Directly or through intermediaries such as the IMF or the World Bank, the US seeks to encourage common economic practice the world over, as shown by their promulgation of the 'Washington consensus', meant as a recipe for poor country development (Stiglitz 2000). Despite these efforts, many observers believe that continued economic divergence is a more likely outcome than convergence (Kitschelt et al. 1999: 427–61; Stiglitz 1994: 254–75). It is not just how money is made in different countries that is important. In addition, we need to examine who it is that economies serve; that is, who gets the money. Economies pay off individuals and groups directly; the state distributes the surplus it claims through taxation; both are factors affecting who benefits from a particular economic configuration. Once again, there are differences, even among similar economies such as those in Western Europe and Japan when compared with the US and the UK. Put simply, Japan and Western Europe are 'stakeholder' economies, while the US and, to a lesser extent, the UK are 'shareholder' economies (Giddens 2000). The key is the economic surplus produced by corporations. In stakeholder economies, corporate profits go to long-serving employees; in shareholder economies, the profits go to those who own the companies' shares. This means that stakeholder economies reward the steadfast members of the corporation over the capitalist risk-taking investor, the implication being that organisational loyalty is more important to society than individual accumulation of capital. In addition to these qualitative distinctions, the distribution of income in societies also becomes highly relevant in showing us who receives the rewards of a particular economic system. A measure like the Gini index, which indicates the degree to which incomes are equally distributed, can be very helpful. It summarises the total results of distribution, either through direct compensation to employees on the part of corporations or through the redistribution of corporate surplus through state expenditures. We can ask the question: when all is said and done, which economies produce more equal distributions of income and which do not? We find some interesting clusters of countries. First, incomes are more equal in Western Europe and Japan than they are in the US and the UK. This is consistent with the stakeholder–shareholder distinction: corporations in Western Europe and Japan would distribute more of their surplus to their employees, a larger number, than to their shareholders.</p>

            <p>In contrast, corporations in the US and the UK would pay out larger sums to the smaller proportion of their citizens who are shareholders. Other patterns suggest themselves. The Scandinavian countries have the most equal distributions of income, followed, with the exception of Russia, by Eastern Europe. The US finds itself in the same league as Australia and New Zealand, but most significantly, its income distribution is as unequal as the majority of poorer countries in Africa, Asia, and Latin America. In what must be one of the great ironies of contemporary history, the US and China find themselves tied with Ethiopia, Tunisia, and the Kyrgyz Republic, among the higher inequality countries with identical Gini indexes. Aside from the stakeholder distinction, what accounts for these differences? The presence of an active welfare state in Scandinavia and Western Europe, and its absence in the US, could help explain why the US finds itself in such anomalous company. In the US, the overall taxation rate, the crucial component of any welfare system, is significantly lower than its rich-country counterparts. Less money, in other words, is taken by taxation from the rich and given to the poor. Poor countries find themselves in the same position as the US, and partly for the same reasons. Once again, they typically tax less than countries with more equal income distribution and thus, like the US, have less to redistribute. In addition, and also like the US, they have powerful ruling classes that use political influence to insulate themselves from higher taxes. Thus, they have little welfare and return little to their poor.</p>

            <p>Conclusion Microeconomic ideas about the costs of transactions are rather effective in identifying the situations in which barter is preferred to monetary exchange, and also help to explain the rates of exchange between goods even when barter takes forms which resemble gift exchange. But in order to understand why a particular series of barter exchanges is more commodity-like or more gift-like we need to take account of the socio-political context of the exchange, and of the dual aspect of exchange episodes as material transactions and as signals of the nature of the personal relationships involved. This part of the analysis, however, applies to money-mediated exchange just as much as to barter, and the phenomenon of distinct spheres of exchange, which some writers associate particularly with barter-based economies, turns out to be more general. Because barter transactions resist oversimplified analysis, they provide a useful way of testing and extending the concepts which we apply to exchange in general, but they do not call for a distinct body of theory unique to barter.</p>

        <p><strong>The anthropology of markets customarily begins by dwelling on the distinction between physical marketplaces and 'the market principle' – or 'the diffuse interaction of suppliers and demanders' that determines the 'prices of labor, resources and outputs... regardless of the site of transactions'.</strong> Thus, a periodic, peasant or open-air market on the one hand, and the global electronic futures market for soybeans or eurodollars on the other. The present chapter also marks this distinction, but with the alternative aim of demonstrating the virtues of phasing out the division for advancing the field. I do not claim to be trailblazing a new path, but to be reporting upon a palpable trend that has perhaps not been explicitly articulated in these terms. It is in the review of select recent market ethnographies that I call to the reader's attention a de facto bridging, convergence or integration of the two kinds of markets in fact and in theory, or at least the positioning of the two on a continuum, and a decline of the split model as an inspiration for empirical research. In so far as I continue referring to the two 'types' to make my point, I shall use the conventional vocabulary of market principle and marketplace, or sometimes more pithily, the abstract vs. the empirical market.</p>

            <p>Increasingly exchange transactions occurring anywhere in the world can only be understood with reference to external agencies. Bilateral exchanges in even remote corners of the world cannot be comprehensively understood without meaningful reference to the global contingencies and determinants conditioning the exchange. The purchase of a hand-crafted basket in a Vientiane outdoor market, the consumption of cheese produced on a kibbutz by its own members in the Galilee, or the return of a defective contact lens to an optician in Peoria are each subject to economic (and demonstrably cultural economic) conditions that involve the global system of which I speak. Correspondingly, even global commercial exchanges of the most abstract kind (such as electronic fund transfers in financial markets) are only relatively more suitable to framing in terms independent of local cultural and social processes. As primary exchange locations, marketplaces of all sorts are both sites of global commercial integration as well as one of the principal vehicles by which it is accomplished. The production of cash crops, or for that matter craft goods, locally for the world market is the other side of this coin.</p>

            <p>What is different is that live screenings and festival events that use video conferencing platforms such as Zoom also incorporate novel spaces of audience participation. In addition to participating in Q&As and discussions, viewers are able to type in the chat and discuss as films are playing. This can take several forms; for example, at Africa in Motion and SQIFF online events, it is common for audience members to remediate the expression of "applause" through congratulatory sentiments at the end of the film. Furthermore, audience members often share affirmative and celebratory proclamations, particularly during emotionally intense beats in the film. These forms of communication may be considered inappropriate during an in-person screening in which audiences are encouraged to keep quiet during the main screening. In this way, digital film festivals enable new performances of liveness, characterized more by Couldry's "continuous connectedness" or Moores's understanding of simultaneity than spatial proximity. Paratextual spaces become key places in which audience members are able to perform "presencing," forms of mediated interaction that are concerned with signaling one's presence to another; that is, while intense discussion and debate can still take place, conversation in the Zoom chat often takes the form of often-phatic or emotional communication that are more concerned with making the presence of oneself known to others than with the exchange of novel ideas. In this way, the simultaneity of digital media constitutes a form of intimacy at a distance.</p>
        </details>
        <p>Again, the distinctions and connections between different modes of audience interaction can blur the experience of online film festivals and other media but they can also work to carve a novel space, framing it as distinct from other forms of media consumption. We have argued that in order to understand film festival audiences in the digital, online context, a relational approach to media and audience practice is needed. <strong>Audienceship has been understood as a temporally structured ensemble of practices and performances that constitute complex place-body-technology relationships.</strong> Online film festival audiences exist as a series of connections and distinctions that sit at the intersection between the remaking of post-broadcast domestic space, modes of public address, rhythms and routines of consumption, and forms of audience participation and inactivity. If media events stand apart from the everyday by virtue of their framing—understood here to be a product of audience practices, programming decisions, and media structures—it is in these different sites that the frame of the film festival is performed and negotiated. We have also shown that these different sites for the performance of liveness vary enormously between festivals and between different audience demographics. In some cases, online film festival audienceship very much elides with both broadcast and post-broadcast televisual modes of watching. In other cases, it takes on a new space and temporality, of a multi-temporal event that offers viewers the possibility to participate and to remake their domestic space—however temporarily—in the process. These distinctions create a web of audience agency and festival structure within which audiences participate in the performance of film festivity by making certain choices within the nexus of their existing media practices, rhythms, and rituals. While film festivals set the terms within which temporalities of audienceship and the forms of participation may take place, audiences play an active role in the realization of festival temporality, space, and online audience presence.</p>

            <p>These multiple forms of audience-ship, from those that are closer to televisual modes of watching to those that carve out a new space of festival interaction and community, are variously characterized by experiences of loss of community and physical sociality, as well as excitement and new connections. Understanding the diversity of online film festival audiences is particularly important because, as festivals move forward and many take on hybrid forms of film exhibition (employing online and in-person film exhibition), the connections and distinctions outlined in this chapter will play a role in how audiences navigate hybrid programs and in which context they choose to view content. Film festivals, going forward, have the option to cater to emerging forms of audienceship and digitally constituted publics, post-broadcast televisual types of audiences, or to revert to trying to foster traditional in-person forms of festivity. Or to adopt a blended approach which spans and draws from both everyday media and the liveness of the in-person cinematic experience.</p>

            <p>Bestor describes an isolated Bath, Maine, dock scene at dusk. About 20 buyers from as far south as New Jersey, half of them Japanese, crowd around three tuna extracting tiny core samples to examine the color, fingering the flesh to assess the fat content, sizing up the curve of the body to guess what the inside of each fish would look like when cut open, and checking carefully the condition of the bodies for damage from harpoons or careless handling. After a short period, the Japanese buyers return to their trucks to call Tokyo on their cell phones to get the morning prices for bluefin tuna at the Tsukiji market, which has just finished its auctions for the day. On the basis of this information, secret bids are submitted to the dock manager and the deals are closed. The fish are packed in ice and loaded in the back of trucks that head for JFK airport in New York, 'where the tuna will be air-freighted to Tokyo for sale the next day'. While Bestor offers only enticing snapshots of the supply side, his demonstration of how the inflated commercial value of the fish is determined by a set of coherent cultural expectations by traders in Tokyo, who are in turn responding to the demands of their customers. Bestor makes detailed application of Marshall Sahlins's illustration of the 'meaningful calculus of food preferences' being 'the symbolic logic which organizes demand' in the market for meat in the United States. He then relates the specifics of Japanese culinary tastes to the organisation of the market, which is not merely a mirror for what one might call the social relations of consumption, but a contributor to it.</p>
        </details>
        <p>Bestor says, 'The market and its provisioning roles are also generators of cultural meaning – they allocate and confirm the "cultural capital" of market traders, chefs, restaurateurs, and retailers who in turn fashion the social formation of "distinction"'. The particular agency of traders, marketers and other middlemen or women in the fashioning of taste forms an important component of the supply–market–demand complex that anthropologists are progressively pursuing, whether they formulate it in these terms or not. <strong>Traders, particularly in the situations of long-distance exchange that typify contemporary market activities, are not best thought of as passive purveyors of goods, as the expression 'middleman' or 'go-between' might imply.</strong> Instead, as Christopher Steiner has argued in his study of art traders in an Abidjan, Côte d'Ivoire, market, long-distance trade generates the opportunity for creative obfuscation of the true nature of the article of trade, to the advantage of the trader. Steiner is reporting on the market for (West) African art in Abidjan and ultimately beyond. His ethnography is a pithy example of how much of the supply–market–demand complex can be comprehended. A brief recapitulation of Steiner's undertaking and insights is worthwhile. In his words, 'This book takes as its unit of study a group of both itinerant and settled merchants who specialize in the commerce of African art – middlemen who either link village-level object-owners, or contemporary artists and artisans, to Western collectors, dealers and tourists'. In this case, even more than tuna to the sushi-loving Japanese, the highly symbolic freight of the commodity itself invites complex variabilities that influence the structure of trade and expand the role of the traders to that of 'cultural brokers' in the processes of acquiring and selling the objects. Because the merchandise the traders buy and sell is defined, classified and evaluated largely in terms of Western concepts such as 'art' and 'authenticity,' the traders are not only moving a set of objects through the world economic system, they are also exchanging information – mediating, modifying, and commenting on a broad spectrum of cultural knowledge.</p>
        <details>
            <summary>다음 문단 보기</summary>
            <p>Authenticity is an issue because by this point the majority of the objects traded have been altered to convey the impression of attributes or provenance currently popular with Western buyers: religious or ritual nature of the art, association with royalty, and antiquity. In addition to the cultural packaging of the art to enhance its 'utility' to Western understandings, the high commercial value and disappearing supply of what dealers and collectors classify as 'authentic' objets d'art has, most interestingly, led to the expansion of the category to include different kinds of artefacts, such as 'colonial' figures, metal currency and various utility objects. In the case of the new market for slingshots, it can be traced to the entrepreneurial craftiness of an Italian collector who quietly went about buying them up, cornering the as-yet unannounced market for these objects. He then commissioned a photographic coffee-table book of his collection, which helped authorise this category of object as legitimately collectible. 'Scientific' proof is educed to show that the slingshots originated in the pre-colonial era to create a market for the objects within the Western definition of 'authenticity' in African art – i.e., which demands that the style has been conceived in an environment untainted by European influence.</p>

            <p>This theoretical point of departure, that perception is embodied, enables Ryan to argue that virtual experiences count as embodied affective experiences. Rather than seeing consciousness as separate from embodiment, physical action and perception are interdependent. Merleau-Ponty's assertion of the embodied nature of consciousness – that feelings and perceptions are embodied and not solely 'mental states' – lies at the heart of understanding the experience of gameplay. This understanding has subsequently been recontextualized by the explosion of neurological science into philosophy and the humanities. Antonio Damasio, for instance, argues that emotions are 'a complex pattern of chemical neural responses' produced by certain stimuli which result in a 'temporary change in the state of the body proper' (Damasio 2004: 53).</p>
        </details>
        <p><strong>The idea of a disembodied spectator/viewer/reader is a fictional subject created by particular ways of conceptualizing the relationship between 'texts' and 'readers'.</strong> This fiction is founded on the Cartesian model of perception, whereby consciousness is seen as separate to and distinct from embodiment. The legacy of Cartesian dualism has created a particular discourse of transcendence in writing about digital technology. This desire for a transcendent unity is also a key component of the technological imaginary. Friedman observes: Connected to the computer, it's easy to imagine you've transcended your physical body, to dismiss your flesh and blood as simply the 'meat' your mind must inhabit, as the protagonist of Neuromancer puts it (Gibson 1984). This denial is a form of alienation, a refusal to recognize the material basis for your experience. The return of the repressed comes in the form of carpal tunnel syndrome, eyestrain, and other reminders that cyberspace remains rooted in physical existence. (Friedman 1999)</p>

            <p>It also serves to remind us that our bodily experiences of gameplay are not solely emotional or affective – they are also highly physical. The body is always committed or engaged in gameplay, from sensorial perceptions experienced as embodied emotional states, through busy hands and fingers in many games, and all the way through to the entire body being involved when playing Eye Toy. The game interface, 'by providing the connective tissue between our bodies and the codes represented in our machines, necessarily engages them both' (Utterbeck 2004: 218).</p>

            <p>On the other hand, scholars who do regularly carry out work in this subfield are rarely located in prestigious universities, published in prestigious journals, or (in relevant cases) translated into English. Economic anthropology of the Near East faces a few foundational dilemmas. The first is geographical, and thus political as well. Where, and what, is the Near East? In the French anthropological tradition, research focuses heavily on North Africa and the former French colonies. In the American tradition, the Near East is construed in terms of US hegemony after the Second World War, centred around US foreign policy concerns in Israel and the oil-rich countries of the Gulf. The Near East is often assumed, in the United States in particular, to be the same as 'the Muslim World'. But many non-Muslims live in the Near East, and most Muslims in the world live elsewhere. For the purposes of this chapter, I shall include works on the Arab Near East, including North Africa, and I shall review only materials published (if not necessarily originally written) in English.</p>
        </details>
        <p><strong>The Near East is a region where long-standing assumptions in the social sciences can be fruitfully challenged.</strong> It was globalised long before globalisation; circuits of migration for pilgrimage and labour have inscribed the region since the rise of Islam; markets are highly monetised and have been for millennia. The long history of cities, markets, and complex economies in the region might suggest a context where economics rather than economic anthropology would be the dominant theoretical paradigm. After all, until recently economic anthropology has tended to focus on small-scale societies where 'the gift', and not 'the commodity' predominated. Of course, small-scale settings are also important in the region, and in fact villages and Bedouin desert communities have been (with important exceptions) the dominant sites for ethnographic research and theorising in the region. In both urban and rural settings in the Near East, the gift and non-monetary exchanges are crucial to the economy writ large.</p>
        <details>

            <p>It is usually obvious that interest does not stand starkly revealed in ways assumed by economic theory and notions of homo economicus. Economic practices can aim as much at the accumulation of cultural capital as at the accumulation of economic value. Exchanges of gifts, in the broadest anthropological sense, are often crucial to social interaction. In other words, in the economies of the Near East, both the 'gift' and the 'commodity' are relevant and intertwined. These points should not be taken to indicate Near Eastern exceptionalism, however (see, for example, Carrier 1995). Rather, I am suggesting that taking on the theoretical challenges in the Near East can contribute to economic anthropology as a whole. Conducting a serious economic anthropological study of the region demands broad knowledge, including fluency in relevant languages, especially Arabic. A rudimentary knowledge of Islamic law is important as well, since it remains a crucial source of economic regulation in the region, even in states defined as secular.</p>

            <p>The reasons for these different instances are, ultimately, similar. Anthropologists had created very powerful models for analysing total social systems, but ran into intractable problems trying to square these models with the reasons why real people do the things they do. One might say this is really the reflection of a much broader dilemma within social theory, of how to square systemic approaches with individualistic ones. The first begin by imagining some total system or structure – a society, a culture, a world-system – and then try to understand how it is maintained and reproduced over time. The other starts with individual actors pursuing something, and sees society largely as the effect of their actions. Anthropologists have always tended to prefer systemic approaches, but at certain points the theoretical contradictions within a given approach become so overwhelming that there is a sense of crisis. At such points, value tends to become important as a way to bring the advantages of individualistic approaches back in. In the 1950s this happened to British structural–functional anthropology, which for decades had been developing Arthur Radcliffe-Brown's idea that a society could be seen as a kind of organism, whose parts (institutions) all play some role in maintaining social order. By the 1950s they had taken this about as far as it could go. The problem, they discovered, was to understand how individual members of such a society are motivated to maintain and reproduce it, and how, if they were, societies ever change. Some kind of value theory seemed just the thing to provide the answers.</p>
        </details>
        <p><strong>By the 1950s, anthropology faced a crisis in its approach to comparing cultures.</strong> Klyde Kluckhohn proposed a new method by focusing on the county of Rimrock, New Mexico, as a test case for his 'values project'. Rimrock was home to five distinct communities: Navaho, Zuñi, Mormon, Texan, and Mexican-American. Kluckhohn believed this setting provided a unique opportunity to observe how different value systems adapted to the same environment. He defined 'values' as 'conceptions of the desirable', which influence choices between different actions. Values, according to Kluckhohn, are not merely desires but ideas about what people ought to want. The challenge lay in connecting these abstract conceptions to specific behaviors. Traditional value analysis was largely interpretative, focusing on key terms like 'harmony' or 'success' within a cultural context. However, these terms were often idiosyncratic, making systematic comparison difficult. Kluckhohn introduced 'value orientations' as a second level, encompassing assumptions about human existence, knowledge, and fulfillment. These orientations were more uniform and easier to compare across cultures. Despite its innovation, the project struggled to translate these refined concepts into concrete values, and ultimately, the Rimrock study was published without conclusions.</p>

            <p>In the early 1980s, interest in value resurfaced as anthropology sought to move beyond structuralist models. Saussurean models of value, which focused on meaningful difference, became prominent. Structuralists were concerned with systems of knowledge and the codes by which people organize experience. Saussurean approaches emphasized that the meaning of a term is defined in relation to other words within a system. This perspective was attractive to those studying consumption, as distinctions between consumer goods mapped different human identities. Saussurean models were also applied to different societies, such as Melanesian 'gift economies', where objects were valued as 'ways of making relationships visible'. These economies differed from commodity economies, but value was still defined in the eyes of others within a larger system of categories. The 1980s saw attempts to break from classical structuralism, leading to post-structuralism and practice theory. Some returned to economic theories of value, while others retooled structuralism to create new systemic forms. The choice was between economic and Saussurean approaches.</p>

            <p>From wood and sandstone markers to elaborate marble and granite sculptures, early carvers developed an industry that utilized Rocky Mountain resources and contributed to the economic growth of the region. In the process, they transformed Rocky Mountain burial grounds into sculpture gardens.</p>
        </details>
        <p>Each community cemetery became an ongoing public statement about the level of civilization and cultural sophistication that community had attained. What roles, then, did men and women and notions of gender play in creating the sepulchral sculpture gardens of the Rocky Mountain West? <strong>Since our popular media use the terms 'sex' and 'gender' interchangeably, it may be useful to pause here a moment and reiterate the difference between sex, a biologically determined trait, and gender, a social construct.</strong> The three sexes—female, intersex, and male—are determined by considering such biological traits as anatomy, chromosomes, and body chemistry. They are not absolute categories because no exact boundaries define them and it is possible to move from one sex to another through medical intervention. Most people in the nineteenth century recognized only male and female sexes and understood them to be opposites. In contrast, gender provides an infinite number of possibilities, each associated with a sex or with a sexual orientation and each subtly shifting as society changes. Gender consists of commonly accepted ideas within a social group about how one should express one's sex or sexual orientation in terms of dress, behavior, body type, odor, styles of communication, and other sensory cues. Not only is gender particular to a time and place, but class, race, ethnicity, and many other factors contribute to its composition. Unlike sex, gender can be changed easily and quickly at the will of the individual, who may choose to adopt the traits of one gender today and another tomorrow. The existence of gender was not recognized in the nineteenth century, although its presence was felt in such formulations as the antebellum 'true woman' and the 1890s 'new woman.' Instead, gender traits tended to be understood as the 'natural state' of man and woman, a presumption that biology or God determined them as absolutes. In this way gender remained fused with sex in nineteenth-century thinking. For our purposes, however, it is useful to distinguish between sex and gender. As this chapter will demonstrate, the female sex had relatively little to do with the appearance of Rocky Mountain cemetery sculpture, but gender played a huge role.</p>

            <p>To begin with the obvious, both men and women died and were buried in Rocky Mountain cemeteries. However, a higher proportion of men than women lived in the region, especially in the early years. Men outnumbered women 34:1 in Colorado in 1860, 8:1 in Idaho and Montana in 1870, and 6:1 in Wyoming in 1870. Below the surface of the cemetery, neither sex nor gender exercised a real presence in the late nineteenth-century Rocky Mountain region, despite the larger numbers of men. Undertakers appear to have treated male and female bodies alike in the manner of entombment and burial, and nature pursued the process of decomposition impartially. Above the surface, where the living walked among memorials to the dead, it was a different story. Men organized the cemeteries, designed and maintained them, carved and placed the sepulchral sculptures that would fill them, and therefore remained more visible as a living presence in the cemetery. At the same time, statues of women outnumbered images of men by a wide margin, and they portrayed a particular gendered ideal that positioned woman as emotionally sensitive, spiritually pure, aesthetically ideal, meditative or melancholy, and nonsexual. No set of monuments was considered more appropriate for women's graves, nor did dealers market particular monuments for the graves of men, so the allegorical and ideal female figures that populate the cemetery are as likely to mark the graves of men as women. The result is that inanimate female images dominated the sepulchral sculpture garden, while living men made both the sculpture and the garden.</p>

            <p>Peter Brooks points out that there is a tradition of narrative criticism, including Vladimir Propp, Jean-Paul Sartre and Frank Kermode, which views the act of telling a story as fundamentally different from life because 'in telling everything is transformed by the structuring presence of the end to come, and another, opposite tradition, including Claude Bremond and Jean Pouillon, for whom the action of a novel takes place before the eyes as a 'kind of present'. The relation of this quasi-present of reading to the structural retrospect of tense in the novel is an issue to which this book returns in each of the chapters that follow. A fictional narrative encourages us to think of the past as present no more than it encourages us to think of the present as a future past. But whereas narrative theory has explored the first implication, of what Ricoeur calls the presentifying of the past, exhaustively, through the themes of memory, the reliability of the narrator and other aspects of retrospect, it has paid far less attention to the correlative issue in which the present is experienced in a mode of anticipation. Narrative is understood as retrospection more readily than it is understood as anticipation, but it cannot really be one without also being the other. If, in order to look back at what has happened, we tell a story, we must also know that the present is a story yet to be told. The present is the object of a future memory, and we live it as such, in anticipation of the story we will tell later, envisaging the present as past.</p>
        </details>
        <p>The present might be lived in anticipation of some future present from which it is narrated, but this may also entail the anticipation of events between the present present and the future present from which it is narrated which will also be part of that story. For many years, the study of narrative has been attending to the notion of the present as a place from which we continuously revise stories about the past, and much less attentive to the relationship between storytelling and the mode of continuous anticipation in which we attach significance to present moments. <strong>There are some excellent studies of fiction in relation to the philosophy of time, but the approach is usually orientated around the search for lost time, around the remembrance of things past and the way they inhabit the present.</strong> The concern of this book is with the relationship between storytelling, future time, and the nature of being. It begins from two propositions. The first is that the reading of fictional narratives is a kind of preparation for and repetition of the continuous anticipation that takes place in non-fictional life. The second is that the place of fictional narrative in the world has altered since the beginning of the twentieth century, and that fiction has been one of the places in which a new experience of time has been rehearsed, developed and expressed. These propositions give fiction, and the study of fiction, a critical role in the understanding of what lies outside of fiction.</p>

            <p>This question of anticipation, or of a mode of being which experiences the present as the object of a future memory, has one of its fictional correlatives in the structural retrospect of the novel, but it can also be related to the question of prolepsis, or the kind of fictional flashforward that conjoins a 'present' moment to a future one. The idea that this anticipatory mode of being might be a characteristic of contemporary culture, the contemporary novel, and even of human being in general is one that informs the discussion of the first three chapters of this book. Chapter 2 looks at the concept of the present from Augustine's puzzle about the non-existence of the present to Derrida's critique of the metaphysics of presence. The aim of this chapter is to consider the contemporary novel in the context of social theories of time and philosophical accounts of time. It takes three concepts of time in contemporary cultural theory, which it names as time–space compression, accelerated recontextualisation and archive fever, and three philosophical approaches to time which have some relevance for a future-orientated theory of narrative and which are derived from Husserl, Heidegger and Derrida. In the context of these ideas, the chapter argues against the predominance of 'retrospective' models of narrative, such as Linda Hutcheon's 'historiographical metafiction', as a basis for characterising the contemporary novel. Chapter 3 offers an analytical framework for the concept of prolepsis designed to take the term forward from Genette's influential account in such a way that it is capable of accounting for effects formerly considered as metafictional. Chapter 4 turns back to philosophy in order to establish a set of connections between temporality and self-consciousness. Like the idea of retrospect in narrative theory, the idea of self-consciousness has played a significant part in critical characterisation of the contemporary novel, and this chapter aims to show the inseparability of a problematic of self-consciousness from the philosophy of time. Chapter 5 follows these issues into the question of inner and outer time, and turns attention on the Augustinian foundations of modern philosophies of time, and an analysis of the narrative aspects of Augustine's Confessions. Chapters 6 and 7 pose a question about the nature of knowledge in fiction, and the difference between what a novel knows about time and what a philosopher knows. These chapters involve readings of Graham Swift's Waterland, Martin Amis's Time's Arrow, Ali Smith's The Accidental, and Ian McEwan's Saturday.</p>

            <p>Despite the opportunities afforded by 'the new digital environment', we will argue that they depend upon a facility for digital means of accessing, altering and disseminating symbolic texts for further consumption. This facility affords the prosumer (the consumer as producer) symbolic wealth in the form of status and recognition, and also in a number of critical cases leads on to economic status and power within the capitalist economy. However, it is important not to overlook the highly gendered nature of the communities that form around these prosumer practices. Female players have often been actively or symbolically excluded; this is as true of the original hacker communities (as we shall see in Chapter 4) as it is of contemporary hard-core modding communities that have formed around online computer game playing. Nor is gender the only axis of power which conditions the accessibility of the necessary skills and techniques needed to be granted status within these communities. Ethnicity and class have their role to play in who gets to play with all the great new digital 'toys'. These power relations are not monolithic, however, and are as subject to processes of critique, resistance and subversion as those that exist in any aspect of culture (as we shall see in Chapter 4 and Chapter 7).</p>

        <p><strong>The relationship between technology and modernity has been a continuing thread within critical theory ever since Marx.</strong> Arturo Escobar here suggests a relationship between the changing technologies of modernity and significant changes in forms of embodiment and cultural practices: With modernity, mechanical models of physical and social life gave way to models centred on the production and maximization of life itself, including the coupling of the body and machines in new ways, in factories, schools, hospitals and family homes. (Escobar 2000: 58) This assumed connection between human subjectivity and our use of technology has come into even sharper focus as the machinery of computing has been woven ever more closely into the fabric of our daily lives. For cyberculture critics, the processes of digitalization and developments in biotechnology have intensified our relationships with technology. In the process, we have once again been forced to attend to the cultural framing of technology as part of our subjectivities, as well as to questions of national, local and individual identities. The consequence of this intensification is that new media technology potentially 'unsettles pre-existing identity formations: national, gendered, ethnic, racialist' (Poster 2002: 30).</p>

            <p>A range of contemporary theorizations of the consequences of technology for our lived subjectivities have made effective use of Haraway's (first published 1985, 1991a) conceptualization of the 'cyborg' as an appropriate figure for late twentieth-century identities. This cyborg was posited by Haraway as a means of acknowledging our 'kinship' with machines. In her view, the cyborg has the radical potential to undermine binary hierarchies of 'race', class and gender through new forms of representation and new metaphors for being. By accepting our connections with machines, she argued we would be forced into 'decentring' the idealized white male subject from his ontological supremacy. This new kinship with machines will be critical in our discussions of both the pleasures of gameplay and the network of relations with machines brought about through single, multiplayer and networked gameplay (see Chapter 6). In what follows, we will lay out a definition of what we will call technicity in order to account for particular formations of identity and power which lie at the heart of computer game cultures. This concept will be useful in considering the computer game as a central site for the familiarization of subjects with technology.</p>

            <p>This is due to the different economic role played by specialized festival circuits, such as the documentary festival circuit, whose relationship with distributors and commercial movie theaters has not been as close (and dependent) as that of festivals focusing on fiction features. In this context, and with the aim of filling the gap of commercial distribution beyond the festival realm, some documentary festivals had already embarked on online distribution initiatives, including the creation of their own specialized VOD platforms. In this chapter, we focus on two pioneering streaming platforms for documentary distribution that were created by (or in close collaboration with) film festivals. The first, DAFilms, originated out of an alliance of seven European documentary festivals. The second, Tënk, is an initiative by the French festival États généraux du film documentaire. By contrasting the discourses put forth by the representatives of these platforms with those of the festivals with which they collaborated before and during the pandemic, we identify key factors that contributed to the success or failure of their alliances. We pay particular attention to the processes by which curatorial practices either complement or clash with technical limitations and organizational patterns on both sides of the partnerships.</p>
        </details>
        <p><strong>Our study of collaborative practices employs two concepts, the first one developed within anthropology and the other in management studies.</strong> The first, the anthropological concept of "reciprocity," allows us to evaluate the social dimensions and dynamics of cooperation. The second, "strategic alliance," is derived from management studies and is used to assess the implications and results of alliances forged between partners. Our method combines in-depth interviews with content analysis. First, we conducted in-depth structured and semi-structured interviews with the representatives of the platforms and festivals. These encounters took place by telephone or videoconference between January and March of 2021. Second, we analyzed the structure and content of the DAFilms and Tënk websites, as well as the websites of the festivals with whom they collaborated. In order to track changes and analyze how these platforms and festivals adapted their activities to respond to the pandemic, we did additional close readings of their social media posts and newsletters, as well as materials appearing in trade publications.</p>

            <p>In what follows, we examine two examples of platform-festival collaboration during the pandemic. In our first case study, DAFilms, we analyze why a VOD platform born out of an alliance of festivals was not necessarily the preferred streaming option for all its partners during the pandemic. We pay particular attention to organizational aspects, focusing on technological issues and geo-cultural positioning. Moreover, we stress the importance of social connections to understanding the collaboration between partners in a rapidly changing environment. In our second case study, Tënk, we focus on curatorial strategies, examining how the shift to a new collaborative model between festivals and this platform during the pandemic failed to work in the long term. Here the analysis revolves around issues of distinction and symbolic value, as well as examining the controversies surrounding issues of quantity versus quality brought about by the surplus of festival-provided films on this online platform that had previously distinguished itself through its editorial identity.</p>

            <p>Accustomed to thinking of non-state systems and different kinds of states and economies, anthropologists note the short-term nature of these sociological representations because they all centre on the role of states in capitalist systems. When we add a historic dynamic of globalisation that expands commodity relations around the planet, we see that the conditions of accumulation and the roles of states continuously change as different kinds of political and economic roles rise and fall at different times and in different places. With the globalisation of production, some owners of capital pressure those states that have maintained conditions favourable to capital to adopt protectionist measures, while others push in other directions. This is apparent if we consider the different ways that firms sought to protect their profit and improve their competitive position in the final third of the twentieth century.</p>
        </details>
        <p><strong>In the United States, many firms focused on reducing the cost of labour by a sustained attack on organised labour or by exporting jobs to Third-World countries that offered plentiful, low-cost female labour for labour-intensive manufacturing processes in textiles, garments, shoes, toys and electronics.</strong> In Europe, on the other hand, countries were protected by tariff barriers and inexpensive regional and migrant labour. Japanese corporations increased productivity by revamping manufacturing methods and increasingly used low-cost labour in Taiwan, South Korea, Thailand and Malaysia. Low-cost labour, however, was not available everywhere. In Latin America, industrial workers joined with the growing urban middle classes and the influxes of rural migrants to produce populist movements that, among other things, demanded a share of the fruits of industrialisation. These countries were not attractive to corporations that wanted a labour force that could be denied an increasing share of the wealth they created.</p>
        <details>
            <summary>다음 문단 보기</summary>
            <p>In other parts of the world, the situation was different: Hong Kong, Taiwan, Singapore and South Korea maintained authoritarian control over their middle classes and workers, often with direct military and police assistance from the United States. Thus, the policies of different states created different environments, more or less attractive to multinational corporations. National trade policies exposed First-World corporations to competition or protected them from it. As the global system expanded the role of states changed, sometimes quickly. And of course when states had to approach the World Bank for loans, they lost control of their economic policies. These instances show why the global system is chaotic and not given to prediction: the forces at work are complex and contradictory. For instance, we cannot specify a single set of functions for all states: states gain influence; states lose influence; American foreign policy sets the stage for oppression of labour in Asian lands; Asian lands offer opportunities for corporations seeking cheap labour; and so on.</p>

            <p>The aim of this chapter is to articulate the origin of the paradox that theory building on conceptual change yields an increasingly sophisticated teacher-alienating output. Given its origin, the question remains how to overcome this paradox and therewith to close the theory-practice gap. The solution may be to abandon the idea of conceptions as an unchanging core of the personality residing in individuals as mental structures. Therewith, one can overcome the requirement of attributing conceptions to individuals and the inherent narrative construction of idem-identities by characterization that justify such attributions. One way to do this is to perceive conceptions as consisting of a dialectical unit of all relevant (meaning-making) semiotic resources publicly made available by a speaker in a situation such as talk, gesture, and context. Here, the situation rather than the individual is the unit of analysis, which conforms to a contemporary notion of knowledge as a distributed and situated entity. Indeed, such a notion and the practice in which s/he is engaging, which accounts for both the intentional and physical orders of causality. This approach thus overcomes the Cartesian dualism and therewith the methodological limitations that occur when attributing conceptions to individuals and therewith failing to take into account how individuals simultaneously experience and produce practice through embodied actions.

        <p><strong>In a typical study of students' conceptions and conceptual change, researchers analyze what a student does or says in a classroom or in an interview and recognizes ideas that match or do not match their own understanding of the topic.</strong> Attributing the perspective they recognize in the student, those studies support the idea that a conception is the way by means of which an individual intrinsically conceives (of) a given phenomenon. They then hypothesize the existence of some mental structures that can be theoretically and objectively re-constructed based on what is observed in a student's performance. Thus, researchers studying conceptions commonly assume that the observer and the observed are separate entities. However, even in the most theoretical and hardest of all sciences, physics, the independence of the measured object and the measuring subject is not taken for granted: Light, for example, will present itself as waves or as particles depending on how we examine it. The artificial sense of separation from the object(s) of study found in many accounts on students' conceptions makes irrelevant the relationship that exists between the observer and the observed: an interdependence and co-emergence of the observer and the observed. This tight relation exists because each participant not only reacts upon what others say but also acts upon the reactions that his/her own actions give rise to. With this situation come epistemological, practical, and ethical implications for those researching in mathematics and science education.</p>

            <p>Positing or questioning the existence of an objective reality mediates how we accept or reject another human being and the worldviews s/he develops. It provides a rationale that guides our actions. This is especially important when it comes to teaching and learning at a time where the ability to deal with the plurality and diversity of human culture have emerged as significant referents for our social behavior. The most central challenge we face today is the question of reality. With respect to the relation of the observer and the observed, the author suggests that there are two postures to reality and objectivity. One assumes that what an observer's actions and knowledge does not affect the object of observation. The other posture recognizes that the observer is constitutive of the observed phenomenon, particularly in his or her ability to distinguish different aspects of a situation. Thus, this framework helps us understand how psychological and socio-cultural perspectives distinctly define the observer. That difference in nature can be captured the following way. Whereas the former attributes conceptions to the students, the latter situates conceptions in the observer who identifies them. The significant epistemological divergence entailed by these two postures has practical implications.</p>

            <p>Peter Brooks points out that there is a tradition of narrative criticism, including Vladimir Propp, Jean-Paul Sartre and Frank Kermode, which views the act of telling a story as fundamentally different from life because 'in telling everything is transformed by the structuring presence of the end to come, and another, opposite tradition, including Claude Bremond and Jean Pouillon, for whom the action of a novel takes place before the eyes as a 'kind of present'. The relation of this quasi-present of reading to the structural retrospect of tense in the novel is an issue to which this book returns in each of the chapters that follow. A fictional narrative encourages us to think of the past as present no more than it encourages us to think of the present as a future past. But whereas narrative theory has explored the first implication, of what Ricoeur calls the presentifying of the past, exhaustively, through the themes of memory, the reliability of the narrator and other aspects of retrospect, it has paid far less attention to the correlative issue in which the present is experienced in a mode of anticipation. Narrative is understood as retrospection more readily than it is understood as anticipation, but it cannot really be one without also being the other. If, in order to look back at what has happened, we tell a story, we must also know that the present is a story yet to be told. The present is the object of a future memory, and we live it as such, in anticipation of the story we will tell later, envisaging the present as past.</p>
        </details>
        <p>The present might be lived in anticipation of some future present from which it is narrated, but this may also entail the anticipation of events between the present present and the future present from which it is narrated which will also be part of that story. <strong>For many years, the study of narrative has been attending to the notion of the present as a place from which we continuously revise stories about the past, and much less attentive to the relationship between storytelling and the mode of continuous anticipation in which we attach significance to present moments.</strong> There are some excellent studies of fiction in relation to the philosophy of time, but the approach is usually orientated around the search for lost time, around the remembrance of things past and the way they inhabit the present. The concern of this book is with the relationship between storytelling, future time, and the nature of being. It begins from two propositions. The first is that the reading of fictional narratives is a kind of preparation for and repetition of the continuous anticipation that takes place in non-fictional life. The second is that the place of fictional narrative in the world has altered since the beginning of the twentieth century, and that fiction has been one of the places in which a new experience of time has been rehearsed, developed and expressed. These propositions give fiction, and the study of fiction, a critical role in the understanding of what lies outside of fiction.</p>

            <p>This question of anticipation, or of a mode of being which experiences the present as the object of a future memory, has one of its fictional correlatives in the structural retrospect of the novel, but it can also be related to the question of prolepsis, or the kind of fictional flashforward that conjoins a 'present' moment to a future one. The idea that this anticipatory mode of being might be a characteristic of contemporary culture, the contemporary novel, and even of human being in general is one that informs the discussion of the first three chapters of this book. Chapter 2 looks at the concept of the present from Augustine's puzzle about the non-existence of the present to Derrida's critique of the metaphysics of presence. The aim of this chapter is to consider the contemporary novel in the context of social theories of time and philosophical accounts of time. It takes three concepts of time in contemporary cultural theory, which it names as time–space compression, accelerated recontextualisation and archive fever, and three philosophical approaches to time which have some relevance for a future-orientated theory of narrative and which are derived from Husserl, Heidegger and Derrida. In the context of these ideas, the chapter argues against the predominance of 'retrospective' models of narrative, such as Linda Hutcheon's 'historiographical metafiction', as a basis for characterising the contemporary novel. Chapter 3 offers an analytical framework for the concept of prolepsis designed to take the term forward from Genette's influential account in such a way that it is capable of accounting for effects formerly considered as metafictional. Chapter 4 turns back to philosophy in order to establish a set of connections between temporality and self-consciousness. Like the idea of retrospect in narrative theory, the idea of self-consciousness has played a significant part in critical characterisation of the contemporary novel, and this chapter aims to show the inseparability of a problematic of self-consciousness from the philosophy of time. Chapter 5 follows these issues into the question of inner and outer time, and turns attention on the Augustinian foundations of modern philosophies of time, and an analysis of the narrative aspects of Augustine's Confessions. Chapters 6 and 7 pose a question about the nature of knowledge in fiction, and the difference between what a novel knows about time and what a philosopher knows. These chapters involve readings of Graham Swift's Waterland, Martin Amis's Time's Arrow, Ali Smith's The Accidental, and Ian McEwan's Saturday.</p>

            <p>Networks based on kinship or local origin can be enormously important in job allocation anywhere, and wherever there is ethnic complexity, this will be evident in the ethnic makeup of the labour market. This factor has probably been underestimated by many researchers with training in disciplines other than anthropology, for they generally have not been equipped with research methods that readily reveal informal networks. As noted above, culture associated with ethnic groups can also be important when specialised professional skills are among the resources that flow within ethnic boundaries. Cultural values may also direct economic activities and preferences in other ways. In a study of Pakistani immigrants in the English Midlands, Dahya (1974: 113) found that 'the immigrants' scale of preferences... differ in a significant manner from that of the native proletariat with regard to consumption patterns, aspirations, prestige symbols etc.'. He saw their poor housing standards partly as the result of an economic preference for saving and sending remittances to Pakistan, and partly as an expression of cultural values which did not accord prestige to housing of the sort that is standard in England. Seeing the difference in housing between British and Pakistani workers as a sole result of ethnic discrimination was therefore misleading.</p>

        <p><strong>Although class and ethnicity are clearly two distinct forms of social differentiation, they are rarely independent of each other.</strong> In most contemporary societies with more than one ethnic group, class and ethnicity overlap in the sense that the division of labour to a greater or lesser extent follows ethnic lines. In some societies, such as the United States and South Africa (at least under apartheid), ethnicity is highly racialised, meaning that visible differences play a central part in the structuring of class. Even in Britain, Hall has argued that 'race is the modality in which class is "lived"' (1980: 340), thus claiming that class differences are largely understood as race differences. At the level of popular representations, this is often the case. In an ethnically-ranked society, it will be difficult to form alliances between black and white underprivileged workers, for instance, given the fact that everybody knows that whites are ranked above blacks. However, in reality the relationship is rarely one-to-one, and race-ethnicity tends to cut across class; there is, for example, a considerable black middle class and a white lumpen proletariat in the United States.</p>

            <p>Ethnic segregation nonetheless inhibits social mobility among less-advantaged groups. The often mono-ethnic interpersonal networks used in economic careers, the varying importance placed on education within the group, the cultural policies of the state (favouring, for example, certain languages over others) and widespread stigma may all contribute to the creation of relatively fixed 'ethnoclasses' in highly differentiated class societies. Institutionalised racism in the past may also play an important part, as in the United States. It was noted above that social mobility can, in certain contexts, lead to ethnic reclassification: a successful Creole could become a Coloured. It is also worth noting that several immigrant groups to parts of the New World, such as Portuguese in Trinidad and Irish in the United States, were recognised as 'proper whites' only after a process of upward mobility. In general, ethnic markers such as skin colour, religion and language tend to lose much of their relevance in situations of social mobility. Put differently, as the German writer Hans Magnus Enzensberger (1993) observed, nobody ever complained about the skin colour of the Sultan of Brunei.</p>

            <p>From wood and sandstone markers to elaborate marble and granite sculptures, early carvers developed an industry that utilized Rocky Mountain resources and contributed to the economic growth of the region.

        <p>Each community cemetery became an ongoing public statement about the level of civilization and cultural sophistication that community had attained. What roles, then, did men and women and notions of gender play in creating the sepulchral sculpture gardens of the Rocky Mountain West? Since our popular media use the terms 'sex' and 'gender' interchangeably, it may be useful to pause here a moment and reiterate the difference between sex, a biologically determined trait, and gender, a social construct. The three sexes—female, intersex, and male—are determined by considering such biological traits as anatomy, chromosomes, and body chemistry. They are not absolute categories because no exact boundaries define them and it is possible to move from one sex to another through medical intervention. Most people in the nineteenth century recognized only male and female sexes and understood them to be opposites. In contrast, gender provides an infinite number of possibilities, each associated with a sex or with a sexual orientation and each subtly shifting as society changes. <strong>Gender consists of commonly accepted ideas within a social group about how one should express one's sex or sexual orientation in terms of dress, behavior, body type, odor, styles of communication, and other sensory cues.</strong> Not only is gender particular to a time and place, but class, race, ethnicity, and many other factors contribute to its composition. Unlike sex, gender can be changed easily and quickly at the will of the individual, who may choose to adopt the traits of one gender today and another tomorrow. The existence of gender was not recognized in the nineteenth century, although its presence was felt in such formulations as the antebellum 'true woman' and the 1890s 'new woman.' Instead, gender traits tended to be understood as the 'natural state' of man and woman, a presumption that biology or God determined them as absolutes. In this way gender remained fused with sex in nineteenth-century thinking. For our purposes, however, it is useful to distinguish between sex and gender. As this chapter will demonstrate, the female sex had relatively little to do with the appearance of Rocky Mountain cemetery sculpture, but gender played a huge role.</p>

            <p>To begin with the obvious, both men and women died and were buried in Rocky Mountain cemeteries. However, a higher proportion of men than women lived in the region, especially in the early years. Men outnumbered women 34:1 in Colorado in 1860, 8:1 in Idaho and Montana in 1870, and 6:1 in Wyoming in 1870. Below the surface of the cemetery, neither sex nor gender exercised a real presence in the late nineteenth-century Rocky Mountain region, despite the larger numbers of men. Undertakers appear to have treated male and female bodies alike in the manner of entombment and burial, and nature pursued the process of decomposition impartially. Above the surface, where the living walked among memorials to the dead, it was a different story. Men organized the cemeteries, designed and maintained them, carved and placed the sepulchral sculptures that would fill them, and therefore remained more visible as a living presence in the cemetery. At the same time, statues of women outnumbered images of men by a wide margin, and they portrayed a particular gendered ideal that positioned woman as emotionally sensitive, spiritually pure, aesthetically ideal, meditative or melancholy, and nonsexual. No set of monuments was considered more appropriate for women's graves, nor did dealers market particular monuments for the graves of men, so the allegorical and ideal female figures that populate the cemetery are as likely to mark the graves of men as women. The result is that inanimate female images dominated the sepulchral sculpture garden, while living men made both the sculpture and the garden.</p>

            <p>Ethnicity may be organized horizontally or vertically; the ethnic groups may be ranked or unranked. When they are relatively unranked, inter-group competition for scarce resources is likely to occur, although the degree of ethnicization of such competition depends on the degree of ethnic incorporation. When the groups are ranked, an ethnic stigma is often attached to subordinate groups, typically by way of a set of stereotypes deeming their culture and practices as inferior. Ethnic stigmata can be fought (as in the Black Consciousness movement), but they can also be internalized and become part of the self-identity of the subordinate group. In the latter case, members of the group are likely to try to escape from the stigmatization through changing their way of life. In parts of Latin America, for example, individuals classified as indios (Indians) may change their language (to Spanish) and their mode of dress in order to be re-classified as cholos (mixed people). Ethnic groups do not exist eternally. Whenever they continue to exist as distinguishable social groupings over a long period of time, it is either because of inescapable stigma from greater society or because they offer something deemed valuable to their members. This could be a sense of belonging and ontological security; it could be something more instrumental, such as material gain and economic opportunity.</p>
        </details>
        <p>Economic activity and ethnic identity Long before the term 'ethnicity' became common in anthropological (and other academic) writings, anthropologists had been interested in the relationship between cultural differences and economic activities. <strong>In many of the societies that anthropologists studied, several distinct groups co-existed and forged inter-group trade relationships or structured forms of economic complementarity whereby certain groups specialized in, or monopolized, particular technologies, crops or ecological sub-systems.</strong> Thus, in the North-Western province of Pakistan (Swat valley), Frederick Barth (1956) showed how the three ethnic groups living in a particular area occupied different 'ecological niches'. The ecological perspective was commonly applied to studies of ethnic complementarity or 'symbiosis' at the time, and Barth argued that the mutual dependence could be likened to the relationship between species in an ecosystem. The dominant group, the relatively centralized Pathans, were cereal farmers whose geographical boundary coincided with the point of altitude beyond which two annual harvests became impossible. Beyond this boundary, the Kohistanis had adapted to a dual economy of less-intensive agriculture and livestock. The third group, the Gujars, were 'symbiotically' related to both Kohistanis and Pathans in their respective areas. They were livestock herders who exchanged goods and services with the dominant populations to varying degrees. A combination of ecological and political factors served to create particular configurations in different parts of the valley.</p>
        <details>
            <summary>다음 문단 보기</summary>
            <p>In more recent research on ethnicity, with which this chapter is mainly concerned, the ecological dimension is rarely made explicit in such a way. Instead, the main concern has consisted – following, inter alia, Barth's later work on ethnicity (1969a, 1969b) – in exploring the maintenance of ethnic boundaries and the flow of resources associated with them. Characteristically, in a later analysis of ethnicity in Swat, Barth (1969a) showed how ethnic boundaries could be transgressed: political competition between Baluchs and Pathans made it advantageous for Pathans to redefine themselves as Baluchs. In other words, there was no direct link here between economic activity and ethnic membership. By way of contrast, Haaland (1969), in a contribution to the same book in which Barth's paper appeared, showed that a change in livelihood could entail a change in ethnic identity. His material from western Sudan showed that Fur people who, due to varying circumstances, switched from agriculture to livestock herding, effectively became Baggara. The question, then, is not whether there is any relationship at all between ethnic identity and economic activity: it is quite clear that such a relationship can usually be identified. Rather, we must ask what kind of relationship can be envisaged. A few brief illustrations may indicate the range of variation in this regard. In sub-Arctic northern Scandinavia, the relationship between Sami reindeer herders and sedentary Scandinavian farmers and fishermen has been characterized by economic complementarity and, in recent decades, competition over territorial rights. At the same time, a great number of Sami are, and have been for generations, permanently settled on the coast, where their economic activities are hardly distinguishable from those of the Norwegian majority. In spite of minimal observable cultural and economic differences, the ethnic boundary remains stable in some communities, while in others there has been a gradual shift to Norwegian ethnic identity. Recent ethnic revivalism in coastal northern Norway takes place independently of economic processes and is largely a product of changed self-definitions and acquisition of key cultural skills such as Sami language. In other words, a change in economic activities can, but need not, be accompanied by a change in ethnic identity.</p>

            <p>Within the city of Rome, no one is allowed to wear trousers or boots... We command that no one shall be permitted to wear very long hair, and no one, not even a slave, shall wear garments made of skins. Other members of ancient society were in a position to participate more fully in social life and to lead a more comfortable, varied, and materially elaborate existence. Their patterns of consumption can be considered in terms of different registers: utility, pleasure, solidarity, differentiation, politics; in practice, of course, they were always multi-dimensional. An increased consumption of meat had its utilitarian aspect in so far as it improved the nutritional quality of the diet; it served the interests of pleasure in both flavor and texture; it was associated with the communal rituals of the civic sacrifice, while the ability to consume it more regularly undoubtedly worked as a means of differentiating oneself from the predominantly vegetarian masses – something which might then be regarded with suspicion in the context of the egalitarian polis, or through the association of excessive meat-eating with barbaric northerners. Clothing is a necessity; clothes made from high-quality wool or silk also offer pleasure and comfort. The clearest evidence for the importance of pleasure in shaping consumption patterns comes from food. Salt, for example, is a nutritional requirement in only very small doses, but it was essential to bring out flavors: 'a civilized life is impossible without salt'. The wish to introduce some degree of pleasure into the unending and monotonous consumption of cereals prompted a move from porridge to bread and placed great emphasis on the importance of accompaniments – opson in Greek – and flavorings such as pepper and fish sauce, expensive but strongly flavored, so they were used in minute quantities. Pliny's use of the past tense clearly implies that the use of such spices was now commonplace; our evidence for their use relates to elaborate elite cuisine, not the diet of the masses, but comparative evidence suggests that the consumption of such goods is not necessarily confined to the very wealthy. It is precisely those whose diet is basic and unvaried who will have the greatest need for flavorings.</p>
        </details>
        <p><strong>Patterns of consumption always have an important social dimension.</strong> Consciously or not, people follow the customs of their society in food, dress, and other material practices and thereby reaffirm their membership and identity; Greeks ate a particular diet and thought of it as peculiarly Greek. Put another way, society established norms, which created a need for certain goods. There were accepted modes of dress, for example; not only for everyday wear (including, for Athenian women, the need for peplos brooches) but different clothing for religious rites and other special occasions – white, more expensive to produce and needing to be cleaned more often. There were established norms for consumption in the context of religious ritual (incense, spices, burnt offerings, clothing), weddings (spices, special fruits, clothing) and funerals (incense, the deliberate destruction of property – compare Plut. Sol.20.5,21.5 on the need to limit the volume of textiles thus sacrificed – and the construction of a suitable monument). Gatherings for the purpose of consumption, of wine or food, were vital forces for social cohesion – the great civic sacrifices and festivals, bringing citizens together – and for reinforcing the solidarity of smaller groups, in aristocratic drinking parties and in the dinners held by groups of officials and members of voluntary organizations. Most of these forms of consumption, and many others, could also be used as means of social differentiation. This aspect is rather more prominent in our sources than normal, taken-for-granted practices, since it was frequently regarded as morally and politically problematic. In a self-consciously egalitarian society such as democratic Athens, deviation from norms of consumption could always be interpreted as an attack on the values of the polis: the purchase of fresh sea-perch seemed undemocratic to the seller or consumer of small fry, while the accusation of opsophagia, eating relishes as if they were a basic foodstuff, was a serious accusation to make against a political opponent. The archaeology of Athenian houses suggests that they were broadly similar until the second half of the fourth century, when large and lavishly decorated ones begin to be built. Athens succeeded to some extent in limiting social differentiation in material practices during this period, but the need to police practices such as the symposium, the upper-class drinking party, makes it clear that 'excessive' consumption continued nevertheless.</p>

            <p>In other societies differentiation was embedded in the social structure, creating demands for goods with which to establish superior social status. The Spartan communal meal ended with competition between the wealthiest elders in the provision of desserts. The Hellenistic monarchies established the model, later followed by the Romans, for expressing and establishing the ruler's superior power and status through lavish and distinctive uses of precious metals, spices, elaborate clothing, and so forth. The Roman elite marked themselves out through dress, diet, housing, drinking practices, dinner parties, slaves, and citrus-wood tables; further, they developed elaborate but unwritten rules about the correct ways of consuming such objects, to distinguish the true aristocrat from someone who could merely afford to live like one. However, the degree of activity at this level of society does not mean that there was no attempt at social differentiation among the lower orders, nor that there was a complete separation between elite and popular consumption. One of the founding theorists of the study of consumption suggested the opposite: taste diffuses slowly through society through imitation. The elite always have a need for novelty and exoticism, using prestige items to differentiate themselves from the mass and to compete amongst themselves; a new form of consumption, if it proves successful, is first imitated by other members of the elite and then by those lower down in society, so that the elite must again strive to differentiate themselves. The change from porridge to bread must first have occurred in elite households, as it presupposes facilities for milling and baking. The masses followed, with the establishment of commercial bakeries, so that barley, the previous staple, comes to be seen initially as food for the poor and then as fit only for animal fodder. The elite, meanwhile, began to insist on finer-quality wheat flour. The same process can be seen in wine and clothing, as the range of options expands to accommodate differentiation not only between but within the broad categories of 'affordable' and 'expensive'. A further function of consumption may be to establish or perform a specific social role. Some Roman freedmen may have imitated the fictional Trimalchio in trying to imitate elite practices; others pursued a distinctive strategy of epigraphic commemoration, both to emphasize their status as citizens and, in some cases, to advertise their professions, implicitly rejecting aristocratic disparagement of trade and manufacturing.</p>

            <p>In assessing Polanyi's legacy, it is important to look beyond anthropology. In the first place, he was an economic historian or political economist, not an anthropologist. Second, his goal was to improve the human condition by overcoming the deleterious precipitates of capitalism (especially fascism and economic depression), not to contribute to the growth of academic disciplines. In other words, he used anthropology and classical studies only as vehicles to reach larger ends. Were he alive today, Polanyi doubtless would be pleased by the diverse group of historians, classicists, economists, political scientists, sociologists, anthropologists and other social thinkers and activists who are using his work as the focus of their conferences. From their collections of papers, it is clear not only that Polanyi's work remains influential but also that its utility is not restricted to 'primitive' or 'archaic' economies. Halperin employs Polanyi's concept of householding to illuminate resistance to capitalist subsumption among the poor of Cincinnati and its environs, while Lorissa Lomnitz reveals the great importance of reciprocity in the informal economy of all social classes in present-day Mexico and Chile. Walter Neale demonstrates the utility of Polanyi's concept of the 'double movement', the emergence of disembedded capitalism followed by a protective social movement to re-embed some important economic aspects in the political fabric, for understanding Indian modifications of and resistance to British colonial economic policy.</p>

        <p><strong>The relationship between anthropology and political economy goes right back to the beginnings of anthropology in the nineteenth century, with the work of Lewis Henry Morgan, Karl Marx, and Friedrich Engels.</strong> However, as is well known, the two traditions rather drifted apart early in the twentieth century. Generally, the 'grand narratives' of evolution were either rejected as speculation or seen as irrelevant to research. There were many reasons for this: the development of fieldwork by Franz Boas, Bronislaw Malinowski, and their students; the belief that pre-monetary and pre-industrial economies had their own dynamics and logics which were different from those of the modern capitalist and socialist systems; and the ascendancy of Émile Durkheim, Max Weber, and Talcott Parsons as the main sources of structural-functional and modernization theory. After the Second World War, the two traditions began to draw together again and grand narratives began to come back into fashion. For one thing, there was an increasing overlap in the methods used by anthropologists and historians and in the materials they collected, both in areas where there were relatively few historical records, such as West Africa, and in areas where there was a rich historical tradition, such as Europe and Latin America.</p>

            <p>Some theoretical traditions such as substantivist economic anthropology also drew extensively on history, particularly the work of Polanyi as interpreted by George Dalton and others. As decolonization proceeded and the superpowers of the period, the United States and the Soviet Union, were increasingly involved in competition and proxy wars, many societies started to experience increasing social and political instability, and 'modernization theory' became increasingly unsatisfactory for the analysis of what was going on. The political radicalization in America and Europe which the same proxy wars produced resulted in a resurgence of interest in Marx, and debates between proponents of various readings raged in a new generation of radical journals. One of the most important of these was world-system theory as developed by Immanuel Wallerstein, together with Andre Gunder Frank, Giovanni Arrighi, and Samir Amin. By the 1980s a modified and generalized version of world-system theory was producing fruitful results at the boundaries of anthropology, history, and archaeology. World-system theory had become well-established in the historical, anthropological, and sociological traditions, as the long list of references given by Chase-Dunn and Hall shows.</p>

            <p>We seek to commence this future-oriented discussion. Evidently, we are very much at an early stage in such a formulation and our approach will lean toward the exploratory. Drawing on a variety of sources, we point toward important issues to be raised and directions to be taken. We will touch upon three layers of concern that need to be considered holistically when taking on the challenge of greening film festivals. The first layer tackles the context of festival operations, namely, all arrangements and preparations required to organize festival events. Awareness that operations logistics ought to be laid along an ecological yardstick is growing among both festival organizers and visitors as concerns about climate change and the environmental crisis are gaining weight. In order to make the transition toward greener practices in the festival world, substantial efforts are needed. In particular, Covid-19 is making us face the facts regarding film festivals' share in harmful air travel.</p>
        </details>
        <p>The second layer addresses the emergent discourse of environmentalist media studies. <strong>There has been a notable recent increase in interest in environmentalist critique in visual and media studies.</strong> What can film festival scholars learn from it and in turn contribute to the area? The Internet infrastructure has long been masked and kept tidily out of the view of most of the population. Let's consider critically the consequences of the virtualization of film festivals, among other online media streaming. In this section, we will warn against simplistic framing of virtual events as a green solution. The third layer puts the 'eco' back into 'ecosystem.' The phrase 'festival ecosystem' itself is becoming popular in the discourse on film festivals in which 'ecosystem' takes its more general figurative sense beyond the original association with the biological environment. We think that the time is right to bring what we are calling the festival ecosystem back into a more literal relationship with 'environmental media,' media infrastructure, and its material relations to the biological environment. This will entail a rethinking of how that ecosystem can be made to work in balance with our planetary needs regarding its natural resources.</p>

            <p>The success of An Inconvenient Truth on the film festival circuit stood at the beginning of what is arguably one of the most effective campaigns to raise international public awareness on issues of climate crisis. One of the most memorable moments in the film is when Al Gore uses the dramatic power of data visualization to persuade his audience of the alarming state of global warming. We see him deliver his presentation on stage before a huge screen. He shows a graph with CO2 emissions over the centuries and their correlation with temperature change. The pattern appears cyclical until the present age when the curve turns into a steep upward, almost vertical line. Gore stands on a rising scissor lift for the climax: if no action is taken, the line continues to move up and up until it goes off the chart and off the screen. It is standard scientific practice to rely on data for monitoring the condition of our environments, measuring immediate effects, and predicting long-term developments. It is a more recent phenomenon to see an increase in the use of such data in the public domain to raise green awareness. In the 1980s, when the problem of acid rain garnered widespread visibility in Europe and North America, media coverage relied heavily on alarming scenarios featuring dying trees, corroding monuments, and lakes floated with dead fish. The underlying scientific story of harmful SO2 (sulfur dioxide) and NOx (nitrogen) emissions was told, but reporting and governmental campaigns were carried by dystopian imagery.</p>
